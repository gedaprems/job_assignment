00:00:44,053 --> 00:00:46,322
Jojo Betzler.

3
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,423
Ten years old.

4
00:00:48,523 --> 00:00:52,228
Today, you join the ranks
of the <i>Jungvolk</i>

5
00:00:52,328 --> 00:00:55,998
in a very special
training weekend.

6
00:00:57,699 --> 00:00:59,168
It's going to be intense.

7
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:03,940
But today, you become a man.

8
00:01:05,241 --> 00:01:09,544
I swear to devote all
my energies and my strength

9
00:01:09,644 --> 00:01:13,448
to the savior of our country,
Adolf Hitler.

10
00:01:14,582 --> 00:01:18,553
I am willing and ready
to give up my life for him.

11
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,789
So help me God.

12
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,757
Yes, that's right.

13
00:01:22,857 --> 00:01:26,728
- Now, Jojo Betzler, what is your mind?
- Snake mind.

14
00:01:26,828 --> 00:01:29,932
- And, Jojo Betzler, what is your body?
- Wolf body.

15
00:01:30,032 --> 00:01:32,600
- Jojo Betzler, what is your courage?
- Panther courage.

16
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:36,705
- And, Jojo Betzler, what is your soul?
- A German soul.

17
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,707
Yeah, man. You're ready.

18
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,476
- Adolf.
- Hmm?

19
00:01:42,345 --> 00:01:44,579
I don't think I can do this.

20
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:47,249
<i>Was?</i>
Of course you can.

21
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,319
Sure, you're a little bit
scrawny and a bit unpopular

22
00:01:50,419 --> 00:01:53,588
and you can't tie your shoelaces
even though you're ten years old.

23
00:01:53,688 --> 00:01:58,727
But you're still the bestest,
most loyal little Nazi I've ever met.

24
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,063
Not to mention the fact
you're really good-looking.

25
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:04,433
So, you're gonna get out there and
you're gonna have a great time, okay?

26
00:02:04,532 --> 00:02:07,569
- Okay.
- That's the spirit. Okay.

27
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,670
<i>Heil</i> me, man.

28
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:09,905
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

29
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:12,574
What? You can <i>heil</i> me
better than that.

30
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:13,943
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- No...

31
00:02:14,043 --> 00:02:15,878
Just throw it away.
Don't even think about it.

32
00:02:15,978 --> 00:02:17,947
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- No, you're overthinking it.

33
00:02:18,047 --> 00:02:19,949
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
<i>Heil</i> "Hitterler."

34
00:02:20,216 --> 00:02:22,251
Who's "Hitterler?"
Do you even speak German?

35
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:25,154
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- That's not a <i>heil.</i> This is a <i>heil. Heil!</i>

36
00:02:25,254 --> 00:02:27,289
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler! <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
<i>Heil</i> Hitler. <i>Heil</i> Hitler!

37
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,225
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.
<i>Heil</i> Hitler! <i>Heil</i> Hitler!

38
00:02:29,325 --> 00:02:31,227
Ooh, that's it.
You've got it. <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

39
00:02:31,327 --> 00:02:33,561
- Have a great day! You're gonna be
the best. <i>Heil</i> Hitler! <i>Heil</i> Hitler!

40
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:35,663
<i>Heil</i> Hitler! You can do it.
<i>Heil</i> Hitler! <i>Heil</i> Hitler!

41
00:02:35,764 --> 00:02:39,168
<i>Heil</i> Hitler!
<i>Heil</i> Hitler! <i>Heil</i> Hitler! <i>Heil</i> Hitler!

42
00:02:42,138 --> 00:02:45,007
<i>Heil</i> Hitler!

43
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,878
Whoa!

44
00:02:48,978 --> 00:02:52,982
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

45
00:02:53,082 --> 00:02:55,451
<i>Heil</i> Hitler. <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

46
00:03:15,603 --> 00:03:18,007
<i>Heil</i> Hitler. <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
<i>Heil</i> Hitler. <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

47
00:03:18,107 --> 00:03:21,643
<i>Heil</i> Hitler. <i>Heil</i> Hitler. <i>Heil</i> Hitler. <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

48
00:03:32,455 --> 00:03:35,024
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler, Yorki.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler, Jojo.

49
00:03:35,124 --> 00:03:38,360
- Are you ready for the best weekend ever?
- Yes, I am.

50
00:03:38,461 --> 00:03:40,062
Let's go.

51
00:04:20,536 --> 00:04:24,073
Heil! Heil! Heil!

52
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,551
<i>Heil</i> Hitler, guys.

53
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,253
<i>Heil</i> Hitler!

54
00:04:37,353 --> 00:04:41,257
<i>Jungvolk,</i> welcome to the
<i>Hitlerjugend</i> training weekend.

55
00:04:41,357 --> 00:04:44,859
In which we will make
men and women of you all.

56
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,662
My name is
Captain Klenzendorf.

57
00:04:47,762 --> 00:04:49,565
You may call me Captain K.

58
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,133
Captain K. Whoo!

59
00:04:53,135 --> 00:04:56,405
<i>Ja.</i> And this is
Sub-Officer Finkel.

60
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:57,739
This is <i>Fräulein</i> Rahm.

61
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,408
Hey. <i>Heil</i> Hitler, everyone.

62
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,410
So a little about me.
Who am I?

63
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,180
And why am I here talking to a
bunch of little titty-grabbers

64
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,284
instead of leading my men into battle
towards glorious death? Great question.

65
00:05:08,384 --> 00:05:11,819
I've asked it myself every day
since Operation Screw Up

66
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:16,691
where I lost a perfectly good eye in
a totally preventable enemy attack.

67
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,294
And according to my superiors,

68
00:05:18,394 --> 00:05:21,397
you need two eyes to be a
meaningful part of the war effort.

69
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:23,899
Can two-eyed people do this?

70
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,010
- Jesus.
- Over the next two days,

71
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,314
you little critters will get to
experience some of the things

72
00:05:38,414 --> 00:05:41,684
that the mighty German army
goes through every day.

73
00:05:41,783 --> 00:05:44,253
And even though it would appear
our country's on the back foot

74
00:05:44,353 --> 00:05:47,022
and there really isn't much
hope in us winning this war,

75
00:05:47,122 --> 00:05:49,158
apparently
we're doing just fine.

76
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:57,099
Anyway. You boys have all been issued
with your <i>Deutsches Jungvolk</i> daggers.

77
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,502
These are very special
and expensive weapons.

78
00:06:00,603 --> 00:06:02,770
You should never
be without them.

79
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,772
And don't try to
stab each other.

80
00:06:04,872 --> 00:06:06,175
No stabbing!

81
00:06:07,142 --> 00:06:08,277
No stabbing.

82
00:06:08,644 --> 00:06:10,546
This is your first step
towards being men.

83
00:06:11,113 --> 00:06:14,650
Today you boys will be involved in such
activities as marching, bayonet drills,

84
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:18,387
grenade-throwing, trench-digging,
map-reading, gas defense,

85
00:06:18,487 --> 00:06:20,089
camouflage, ambush techniques,

86
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:22,757
war games, firing guns,
and blowing stuff up.

87
00:06:24,193 --> 00:06:27,529
The girls will practice
important womanly duties

88
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,432
such as dressing wounds,
making beds,

89
00:06:30,532 --> 00:06:33,269
and learning how
to get pregnant.

90
00:06:33,369 --> 00:06:34,370
Aw.

91
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,905
I've had 18 kids for Germany.

92
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,242
Such a great year
to be a girl.

93
00:06:40,743 --> 00:06:43,212
All right. Let's get to it.

94
00:06:43,312 --> 00:06:44,913
Come on.

95
00:06:45,481 --> 00:06:46,382
Go!

96
00:06:48,816 --> 00:06:50,386
God help me.

97
00:06:53,322 --> 00:06:55,891
Go, go, go!

98
00:07:01,096 --> 00:07:02,464
Three, two, one,
swastika!

99
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,437
Come on!
Pull it! Come on!

100
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,075
Aaah! Aaah!

101
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,854
- Now finish him.
- Don't, no, no!

102
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:35,397
- Fangs.
- Fangs, <i>ja.</i>

103
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,966
- Serpent tongue.
- Serpent's tongue, <i>ja.</i>

104
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:40,202
- Scales.
- <i>Ja,</i> scales.

105
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:44,239
Because, once upon a time,
a Jewish man mated with a fish.

106
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,374
Whoa!

107
00:07:45,474 --> 00:07:47,543
We, Aryans,
are one thousand times

108
00:07:47,643 --> 00:07:51,113
more civilized and advanced
than any other race.

109
00:07:51,213 --> 00:07:53,549
Now, get your
things together, kids.

110
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:55,451
It's time to burn some books.

111
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:57,419
Yeah!

112
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:36,925
Jews sound scary, huh?

113
00:08:37,025 --> 00:08:38,727
Not to me.

114
00:08:38,827 --> 00:08:41,230
If I met one,
I'd kill it like that.

115
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:45,968
Like... that.

116
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,936
But how would you know
if you saw one?

117
00:08:48,036 --> 00:08:49,571
They could look just like us.

118
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:51,440
I'd feel its head for horns.

119
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,342
And they smell like
brussels sprouts.

120
00:08:53,442 --> 00:08:56,512
Oh, yeah. I forgot about
the brussels sprouts bit.

121
00:08:56,612 --> 00:08:59,815
Imagine catching one
and giving it to Hitler.

122
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:03,118
That'd be a surefire way to
get into his personal guards.

123
00:09:03,218 --> 00:09:05,954
Then we would become
best friends.

124
00:09:06,488 --> 00:09:08,892
I thought I was
your best friend.

125
00:09:08,991 --> 00:09:11,895
Yorki, you're
my second-best friend.

126
00:09:12,027 --> 00:09:14,329
First place
is reserved for the <i>Führer.</i>

127
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:18,734
So, unless you're Hitler hiding in a
fat, little boy's body...

128
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:20,269
I'd be happy
with second place.

129
00:09:20,369 --> 00:09:24,006
I guess I'm just
a kid in a fat kid's body.

130
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:25,974
Case closed.

131
00:09:28,043 --> 00:09:31,580
Raah! Raah! Raah!

132
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,351
When you stand before the
enemy and have to end his life,

133
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:39,488
which of you will have
the stomach to do this?

134
00:09:40,924 --> 00:09:41,990
Good.

135
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,127
There is no room
in Hitler's army

136
00:09:45,227 --> 00:09:47,563
for those that lack strength.

137
00:09:47,663 --> 00:09:49,933
We want hardened warriors.

138
00:09:50,032 --> 00:09:53,068
Those that are prepared
to kill at will.

139
00:09:54,002 --> 00:09:55,237
Can you do this?

140
00:09:55,337 --> 00:09:57,639
- Yes.
- <i>Ja.</i>

141
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:00,742
Johannes.

142
00:10:02,912 --> 00:10:04,379
Can you kill?

143
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:09,384
Pfff. Of course.
I love killing.

144
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:12,754
Good. Come here.

145
00:10:15,624 --> 00:10:17,693
Don't be scared. Come on.

146
00:10:17,793 --> 00:10:20,162
Good.

147
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:29,538
Kill it.

148
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:33,175
Huh?

149
00:10:33,275 --> 00:10:36,478
Wring its neck
and kill the rabbit.

150
00:10:38,113 --> 00:10:39,883
Or are you scared?

151
00:10:39,983 --> 00:10:42,784
I'm not scared. I... I just...

152
00:10:44,052 --> 00:10:45,587
Now.

153
00:10:47,256 --> 00:10:51,693
Place both hands around its
neck and then one hard twist.

154
00:10:52,127 --> 00:10:56,031
He might scream, but we'll just
use the boot to finish it off.

155
00:10:58,935 --> 00:11:01,637
Kill. Kill.

156
00:11:02,137 --> 00:11:04,873
Kill. Kill.

157
00:11:04,974 --> 00:11:07,042
Kill. Kill.

158
00:11:07,142 --> 00:11:09,946
Kill. Kill. Kill.

159
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:13,048
Kill.
Kill. Kill.

160
00:11:13,148 --> 00:11:17,020
Kill. Kill.
Kill. Kill. Kill.

161
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:21,056
Kill. Kill. Kill.
Kill. Kill. Kill.

162
00:11:21,156 --> 00:11:22,858
- Shoo! Come on, shoo.
- Hey! Hey, hey.

163
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:30,098
Good shot.

164
00:11:32,768 --> 00:11:33,970
You are a coward.

165
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,204
Just like your father.

166
00:11:36,305 --> 00:11:38,407
He... He's not a coward.

167
00:11:38,507 --> 00:11:40,442
- He's fighting in Italy.
- Really?

168
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:42,344
But no one has heard
from him in two years.

169
00:11:42,444 --> 00:11:44,179
He is a deserting coward.

170
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:47,182
He's scared and so are you.

171
00:11:48,017 --> 00:11:52,621
You're as scared
as a little rabbit.

172
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,224
Scared little rabbit.

173
00:11:56,325 --> 00:11:58,860
Maybe we should snap
your neck, too?

174
00:11:58,962 --> 00:12:00,395
Jojo the rabbit.

175
00:12:06,802 --> 00:12:08,303
Jojo Rabbit.

176
00:12:08,403 --> 00:12:10,272
Jojo Rabbit.

177
00:12:10,372 --> 00:12:14,676
Jojo Rabbit. Jojo Rabbit.

178
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:23,452
Poor Jojo.
What's wrong, little man?

179
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:27,723
- Hi, Adolf.
- Wanna tell me about that rabbit incident?

180
00:12:27,823 --> 00:12:29,458
What was all that about?

181
00:12:30,093 --> 00:12:31,727
They wanted me to kill it.

182
00:12:32,494 --> 00:12:34,396
I'm sorry. I couldn't.

183
00:12:34,496 --> 00:12:36,933
Don't worry about it.
I couldn't care less.

184
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:38,901
But now they call me
a scared rabbit.

185
00:12:39,002 --> 00:12:40,335
Let them say
whatever they want.

186
00:12:40,435 --> 00:12:43,138
People used to say a lot
of nasty things about me.

187
00:12:43,238 --> 00:12:44,673
"Oh, this guy's a lunatic."

188
00:12:44,773 --> 00:12:47,910
"Oh, look at that psycho.
He's gonna get us all killed."

189
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:53,715
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
The rabbit is no coward.

190
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:58,220
The humble little bunny faces
a dangerous world every day,

191
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,924
hunting carrots for
his family, for his country.

192
00:13:02,424 --> 00:13:05,327
My empire will be
full of all animals.

193
00:13:05,427 --> 00:13:08,898
Lions, giraffes, zebras,

194
00:13:08,998 --> 00:13:11,600
rhinoceroses, octopuses,

195
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,168
rhinoctopuses.

196
00:13:13,268 --> 00:13:15,938
Even the mighty rabbit.

197
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:17,040
Cigarette?

198
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,941
Oh, no, thanks. I don't smoke.

199
00:13:19,042 --> 00:13:22,078
Let me give you
some really good advice.

200
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:23,278
Be the rabbit.

201
00:13:23,545 --> 00:13:26,515
The humble bunny
can outwit all of his enemies.

202
00:13:26,615 --> 00:13:29,886
He's brave and sneaky
and strong.

203
00:13:29,986 --> 00:13:32,821
Be the rabbit.

204
00:13:32,922 --> 00:13:34,256
Jojo!

205
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:37,894
Are you all right, Jojo?

206
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:40,762
Who were you talking to?

207
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,330
Nobody.

208
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:43,865
Oh, I thought you were crying.

209
00:13:43,966 --> 00:13:45,968
Are you a teardrop specialist?

210
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:47,602
No.

211
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:49,604
Case closed.

212
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:54,177
Now, it's time for Jojo
to show those stick insects

213
00:13:54,276 --> 00:13:57,646
who is the real
cowardly rabbit.

214
00:13:58,246 --> 00:14:00,415
I'm sorry,
what are you talking about?

215
00:14:00,983 --> 00:14:01,850
Never mind.

216
00:14:01,951 --> 00:14:03,920
Jojo, where are you going?

217
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,089
To be the rabbit!

218
00:14:06,189 --> 00:14:09,691
Jojo Rabbit. Jojo Rabbit.
Hunting carrots. Jojo Rabbit.

219
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,393
Hey, this is amazing.

220
00:14:11,493 --> 00:14:13,628
We're like two human antelopes.

221
00:14:20,635 --> 00:14:23,839
Now, lads, each of you
will be given the opportunity

222
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,375
to ignite and throw a grenade.

223
00:14:28,276 --> 00:14:31,013
I will personally
be supervising each of you

224
00:14:31,114 --> 00:14:34,416
to make sure you don't blow
your eyes out or something.

225
00:14:34,516 --> 00:14:36,485
All right, who's first?

226
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:37,352
Klaus.

227
00:15:18,693 --> 00:15:19,828
Shit.

228
00:15:19,929 --> 00:15:20,963
Shit!

229
00:15:24,901 --> 00:15:26,668
Don't do that.

230
00:15:28,004 --> 00:15:29,771
Jojo. Jojo.

231
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,641
Finkel! Finkel!

232
00:15:32,741 --> 00:15:33,910
Jojo, Jojo.

233
00:15:37,445 --> 00:15:38,780
O-M <i>Gott.</i>

234
00:15:38,881 --> 00:15:42,051
He looks like
a Picasso painting.

235
00:15:49,858 --> 00:15:51,726
His mother's going to kill me.

236
00:16:05,874 --> 00:16:07,342
My darling cub.

237
00:16:46,115 --> 00:16:47,382
Hey, kid.

238
00:16:52,621 --> 00:16:55,490
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

239
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:58,627
Mmm. My darling little cub.

240
00:16:59,461 --> 00:17:00,395
Why so happy?

241
00:17:00,495 --> 00:17:03,065
Your son is ugly
like a monster.

242
00:17:03,165 --> 00:17:05,467
Hey. You're no monster.

243
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,036
Besides, your scars will heal,

244
00:17:07,136 --> 00:17:08,905
and you'll get most of the
movement back in your leg.

245
00:17:09,005 --> 00:17:10,672
But I'll never be
in Hitler's personal guards.

246
00:17:10,772 --> 00:17:12,440
Ah, you're fine as you are.

247
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:15,111
I'm just happy to have you
back home. Hmm?

248
00:17:15,211 --> 00:17:16,778
Mama Lion worries about her cub,

249
00:17:16,879 --> 00:17:19,382
especially when
Papa Lion isn't here.

250
00:17:19,481 --> 00:17:20,883
Or Inge Lion.

251
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:26,621
Or Inge Lion.

252
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:31,559
You grab the rabbit by the
tail, wrap it around his ear,

253
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,164
tie it all up and then
stuff him back down the hole.

254
00:17:35,998 --> 00:17:38,167
Now then,
let's get on our way, huh?

255
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:41,137
I think getting out of the house will
do wonders for your recuperation.

256
00:17:41,237 --> 00:17:43,306
I don't want to go out there.

257
00:17:43,406 --> 00:17:45,374
What? Don't be silly.
Of course you do.

258
00:17:45,473 --> 00:17:47,475
I look stupid.

259
00:17:47,575 --> 00:17:48,978
People will stare.

260
00:17:49,078 --> 00:17:50,413
Enjoy the attention, kid.

261
00:17:50,512 --> 00:17:52,614
Not everyone's
lucky enough to look stupid.

262
00:17:52,714 --> 00:17:55,784
I, for one, am cursed
to look incredibly attractive.

263
00:17:55,885 --> 00:17:57,987
Now, you're going to
pluck up your courage,

264
00:17:58,087 --> 00:18:01,190
walk out that door and have
an incredible adventure.

265
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,325
Okay?

266
00:18:02,425 --> 00:18:03,692
Okay.

267
00:18:05,094 --> 00:18:07,897
Field Marshal Jojo,
you're our top man.

268
00:18:07,997 --> 00:18:09,698
Prepare to leave the house.

269
00:18:10,366 --> 00:18:11,434
Is it dangerous?

270
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,035
Extremely.

271
00:18:15,037 --> 00:18:16,604
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- Oh, Jesus.

272
00:18:16,838 --> 00:18:17,672
Hey!

273
00:18:17,772 --> 00:18:19,108
- Looking good, kid.
<i>Heil</i> Hitler!

274
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:22,477
<i>Frau</i> Betzler, you're looking
fetching as usual.

275
00:18:22,577 --> 00:18:24,713
Okay, wow.

276
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:27,149
It's because of you
my son can't walk properly

277
00:18:27,249 --> 00:18:28,384
and has a messed-up face.

278
00:18:29,617 --> 00:18:30,785
He stole my hand grenade.

279
00:18:30,886 --> 00:18:32,721
- Just took it...
- <i>Ja, ja.</i>

280
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:36,558
So, you are going to look after
him while I'm at work, hmm?

281
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:39,328
Make sure he has a job
and feels included. Got it?

282
00:18:39,428 --> 00:18:41,897
Got it. <i>Ja,</i> I really got it.

283
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,233
Good.

284
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,302
Guys, this is
Johannes Betzler.

285
00:18:46,402 --> 00:18:47,669
The kid I told you about.

286
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:49,537
Remember,
he stole a hand grenade

287
00:18:49,637 --> 00:18:51,374
and blew himself up
and as a result

288
00:18:51,474 --> 00:18:53,175
I got demoted for negligence.

289
00:18:53,275 --> 00:18:56,445
Now I get to work in this office
with all these wonderful kids.

290
00:18:57,113 --> 00:19:00,815
So, Jojo. I'm sure we can figure
out something for you to do.

291
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,485
- Oh!
- Ideas?

292
00:19:02,584 --> 00:19:03,785
- <i>Ja.</i>
- Guys?

293
00:19:03,886 --> 00:19:04,987
<i>Ja. Ja.</i>

294
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:09,025
Okay, well, we need somebody
to walk the clones.

295
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:15,297
Also, I think maybe he could
hand out this new propaganda,

296
00:19:15,398 --> 00:19:18,700
and deliver
these conscriptions.

297
00:19:19,035 --> 00:19:21,736
I don't suppose
I could be conscripted?

298
00:19:21,836 --> 00:19:22,604
Could I?

299
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:24,206
Oh, yes,
that's a wonderful idea.

300
00:19:24,306 --> 00:19:25,607
Yes, I give
my full permission

301
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:27,675
for you to send this
ten-year-old child into war.

302
00:19:27,776 --> 00:19:29,045
Will someone
get this kid a gun?

303
00:19:29,178 --> 00:19:31,113
And I'd be more than happy
to fight in the front.

304
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:32,248
Get in line, kid.

305
00:19:32,348 --> 00:19:34,150
Okay. Here are
the conscriptions,

306
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,251
and here is a gun.

307
00:19:35,351 --> 00:19:36,751
Ooh! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

308
00:19:36,851 --> 00:19:38,220
It's a bit... for the gun?

309
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,587
No.

310
00:20:14,924 --> 00:20:15,958
Yuck.

311
00:20:18,194 --> 00:20:19,228
Look.

312
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:28,636
What did they do?

313
00:20:30,372 --> 00:20:31,706
What they could.

314
00:20:33,008 --> 00:20:34,043
Come on.

315
00:20:49,925 --> 00:20:52,561
Hey-hey! Jojo Rabbit!

316
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,464
Oh, look at your face.

317
00:20:55,564 --> 00:20:58,733
I am a soldier!
I'm going to war!

318
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:00,668
And you are a postman!

319
00:21:02,271 --> 00:21:06,075
Jojo Rabbit, Jojo Rabbit!

320
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:07,877
Mama?

321
00:21:09,011 --> 00:21:11,679
Field Marshal Jojo is home.

322
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,117
Mama?

323
00:21:20,422 --> 00:21:23,658
Mama? I'm home.

324
00:21:26,061 --> 00:21:27,096
Mama?

325
00:21:45,014 --> 00:21:46,048
Mama?

326
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:57,780
Hi.

327
00:24:38,153 --> 00:24:39,588
What do you want?

328
00:24:40,489 --> 00:24:41,856
Are you a ghost?

329
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:44,893
Sure. A ghost.

330
00:24:53,035 --> 00:24:54,970
Don't make me run, kid.

331
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,405
I'm far too hungry

332
00:24:56,505 --> 00:24:59,041
and you know how much
we love the taste of blood.

333
00:25:05,514 --> 00:25:06,582
Lose something?

334
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,953
I'm not a ghost, Johannes.
I'm something worse,

335
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:13,322
but I think you already
know that, don't you?

336
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:15,023
You know what I am.

337
00:25:15,858 --> 00:25:17,726
- No.
- Yes.

338
00:25:17,826 --> 00:25:19,661
Say it.

339
00:25:19,762 --> 00:25:20,996
Say it!

340
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:22,598
A Jew.

341
00:25:23,766 --> 00:25:25,033
<i>Gesundheit.</i>

342
00:25:25,834 --> 00:25:27,970
You can't be here.

343
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,438
Well, your mother invited me,

344
00:25:29,538 --> 00:25:31,507
so I suppose that makes me
her guest.

345
00:25:31,607 --> 00:25:35,077
- It's not allowed.
- What will you do, sweet <i>Hitlerche?</i>

346
00:25:35,177 --> 00:25:36,211
Hmm?

347
00:25:39,615 --> 00:25:40,649
Of course.

348
00:25:42,184 --> 00:25:43,585
Go on, then. Tell them.

349
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,556
But do you know
what happens if you do?

350
00:25:48,323 --> 00:25:50,692
I'll tell them you helped me.

351
00:25:50,793 --> 00:25:52,728
And your mother, too.

352
00:25:52,828 --> 00:25:54,663
Then we'll all be <i>kaputt.</i>

353
00:25:54,763 --> 00:26:00,202
And if you tell her you know
about me, just one word...

354
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:03,572
I'll do the world
a great, big favor

355
00:26:03,672 --> 00:26:05,441
and cut your Nazi head off.

356
00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:08,410
Got it?

357
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,578
<i>Ja.</i>

358
00:26:18,454 --> 00:26:22,090
I think I'll hold onto this.
It's pretty.

359
00:26:29,899 --> 00:26:31,867
Sheesh. That was intense.

360
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:34,336
- What am I going to do?
- Honestly, no idea.

361
00:26:34,436 --> 00:26:36,104
I mean,
there could be more of them.

362
00:26:36,205 --> 00:26:38,373
Hundreds of them
living in your walls.

363
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:42,344
How did she get control
like that?

364
00:26:42,444 --> 00:26:43,846
She must've used her powers.

365
00:26:43,947 --> 00:26:44,914
Mind control.

366
00:26:45,013 --> 00:26:46,448
Oh, typical.

367
00:26:46,548 --> 00:26:48,918
- Did you see how fast she moved?
- Yes.

368
00:26:49,017 --> 00:26:51,386
Like a little,
female Jewish Jesse Owens.

369
00:26:51,487 --> 00:26:54,256
- And now she's got your fancy knife.
- My knife!

370
00:26:54,356 --> 00:26:57,092
Yeah. Like a little, female
Jewish Jesse Owens,

371
00:26:57,192 --> 00:26:58,962
Jack the Ripper.

372
00:26:59,061 --> 00:27:00,964
You're definitely
in a pickle, my friend.

373
00:27:01,096 --> 00:27:03,065
Ah, what to do, what to do?

374
00:27:03,165 --> 00:27:04,299
- Oh. Got it!
- Got it!

375
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:05,834
- I will negotiate.
- Burn down the house

376
00:27:05,935 --> 00:27:07,836
and blame Winston Churchill.

377
00:27:07,937 --> 00:27:10,305
Or negotiate. Hmm.

378
00:27:25,787 --> 00:27:27,222
Excuse me?

379
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,025
Little girl?

380
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:34,329
Um... Jew girl in the wall?

381
00:27:35,932 --> 00:27:38,734
Yoo-hoo. Jew?

382
00:27:43,805 --> 00:27:49,144
Okay, well, I'll just say what
I have to say and that's this:

383
00:27:49,244 --> 00:27:53,749
I'm not scared of you and I think you
should find somewhere else to live.

384
00:27:53,849 --> 00:27:55,083
Okay?

385
00:27:55,985 --> 00:27:57,452
Not okay.

386
00:28:03,325 --> 00:28:05,460
Get the hell out of my room.

387
00:28:07,462 --> 00:28:09,631
She's pretty rude, you know?

388
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:11,133
That's just my two Pfennige.

389
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:13,602
- And now she's got two knives.
- I know!

390
00:28:13,702 --> 00:28:16,505
- How are you going to chop up stuff?
- I don't know!

391
00:28:16,605 --> 00:28:18,206
Oh, and she's
still up there, too.

392
00:28:18,307 --> 00:28:19,841
That... that thing,
that, that...

393
00:28:19,943 --> 00:28:21,443
- Jew.
- Yeah. Jew, yeah.

394
00:28:21,543 --> 00:28:23,913
- What are we gonna do about that Jew?
- You think of something.

395
00:28:24,013 --> 00:28:25,681
Oh, now I'm the expert?

396
00:28:25,781 --> 00:28:28,417
Stop offering me
damned cigarettes! I'm ten!

397
00:28:28,517 --> 00:28:30,586
All right. Sorry.
I'm stressed out!

398
00:28:30,686 --> 00:28:32,922
Okay, let's talk like turkeys.

399
00:28:33,022 --> 00:28:35,892
You can't tell your mother or that
Jew will cut off your Nazi head,

400
00:28:35,992 --> 00:28:39,628
but there's no reason this thing in
the attic needs to ruin your life.

401
00:28:39,728 --> 00:28:42,731
In fact, you could use it
to your advantage.

402
00:28:42,831 --> 00:28:44,067
How?

403
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:46,134
When someone tries to use
mind powers on me,

404
00:28:46,234 --> 00:28:47,169
know what I do?

405
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:48,704
Use mind powers back on them.

406
00:28:48,804 --> 00:28:51,406
Remember last year when that
one-arm pirate von Stauffenberg

407
00:28:51,506 --> 00:28:53,042
tried to blow me up
with a table bomb?

408
00:28:53,141 --> 00:28:54,142
Yeah, you survived.

409
00:28:54,242 --> 00:28:55,210
Correctomundo.

410
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,511
The only reason
I survived,

411
00:28:56,612 --> 00:28:58,313
apart from having
bombproof legs,

412
00:28:58,413 --> 00:29:00,782
is because I outwitted
old von Stauffy.

413
00:29:00,883 --> 00:29:04,720
I let him think that I was dead,
when in actual fact, I was absolutely fine.

414
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:08,190
By pretending I was dead,
I drew out all the traitors.

415
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,691
So what are you going to do?

416
00:29:10,093 --> 00:29:11,060
Pretend I'm dead?

417
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:13,662
Exactly. Wait, no.

418
00:29:13,762 --> 00:29:15,263
No, what I mean is this:

419
00:29:15,364 --> 00:29:17,265
make her feel safe
and then she'll drop her guard

420
00:29:17,366 --> 00:29:18,767
and then you will be
the one in control.

421
00:29:18,867 --> 00:29:21,737
- Reverse psychology.
- Don't complicate things.

422
00:29:21,837 --> 00:29:23,872
Just use my backwards
mind power trick,

423
00:29:23,973 --> 00:29:25,741
and everything will be fine.

424
00:29:25,841 --> 00:29:27,242
Ooh! I gotta go.

425
00:29:27,342 --> 00:29:29,444
We're having unicorn for
dinner at my place tonight.

426
00:29:29,912 --> 00:29:31,647
Concentrate, Jojo.

427
00:29:31,747 --> 00:29:33,715
Remember,
a Jew living in your wall

428
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:36,251
is better than two Jews flying
around with their bat wings

429
00:29:36,351 --> 00:29:38,720
climbing down chimneys
and eating innocent Nazis.

430
00:29:39,521 --> 00:29:41,657
And don't give her
any more knives.

431
00:29:41,757 --> 00:29:42,791
<i>Tschüss.</i>

432
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:11,186
Darling cub,
why are you up, huh?

433
00:30:11,286 --> 00:30:12,989
Did you eat anything, hmm?

434
00:30:13,089 --> 00:30:14,256
Sorry, I lost track of time.

435
00:30:14,356 --> 00:30:15,992
I was taking a long walk
and having a thing...

436
00:30:16,425 --> 00:30:19,194
What are we going to do with these
laces, huh? My goodness.

437
00:30:19,294 --> 00:30:21,229
You'll learn how to
tie them eventually, no?

438
00:30:21,329 --> 00:30:23,632
- I heard her.
- What?

439
00:30:23,732 --> 00:30:24,766
Who?

440
00:30:26,069 --> 00:30:27,335
Inge.

441
00:30:28,704 --> 00:30:30,073
Her ghost.

442
00:30:30,173 --> 00:30:33,208
Oh. That's so sad for you.

443
00:30:34,376 --> 00:30:35,444
You've lost your mind.

444
00:30:35,544 --> 00:30:36,745
It's sadder for me, though,

445
00:30:36,845 --> 00:30:38,780
because I have to live
with a crazy person.

446
00:30:41,483 --> 00:30:43,485
I heard noises. Upstairs.

447
00:30:43,585 --> 00:30:46,755
Ghosts? Honestly.
You know what I heard? Rats.

448
00:30:46,855 --> 00:30:48,958
Yes, we have them.
Can you believe that?

449
00:30:49,058 --> 00:30:50,525
Dirty animals.

450
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:52,627
I've been meaning to tell you
to stay away from upstairs,

451
00:30:52,728 --> 00:30:54,429
until I've cleared
them all, okay?

452
00:30:54,529 --> 00:30:56,264
I don't need you getting sick.

453
00:30:56,364 --> 00:30:57,599
Okay, Mama.

454
00:30:58,467 --> 00:31:00,836
I'll watch out
for those dirty rats.

455
00:31:02,071 --> 00:31:04,239
Where are all
the goddamn knives?

456
00:31:18,553 --> 00:31:20,388
Are you going to bed, too?

457
00:31:21,656 --> 00:31:23,159
Yes. Soon.

458
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:25,293
I have to tidy
some things first.

459
00:31:25,393 --> 00:31:26,628
What things?

460
00:31:28,131 --> 00:31:29,431
Mama things.

461
00:31:29,531 --> 00:31:30,766
Boy, you have to
trust me, okay?

462
00:31:30,866 --> 00:31:32,567
I'm the boss here, <i>ja?</i>

463
00:31:33,835 --> 00:31:35,470
I guess.

464
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:37,006
Good boy.

465
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:40,009
Yes, but with... with one eye. Like...

466
00:31:41,343 --> 00:31:42,711
Almost.

467
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:44,546
Not quite.

468
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:51,720
Great. You got it.

469
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,854
<i>Ja.</i>

470
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,962
You have to be more quiet.

471
00:32:00,062 --> 00:32:01,630
He heard noises up here.

472
00:32:02,531 --> 00:32:05,300
If I have to choose
between you and my son, I...

473
00:32:10,239 --> 00:32:11,974
I won't know
where to send you.

474
00:32:12,074 --> 00:32:13,508
You hear me?

475
00:32:13,608 --> 00:32:16,045
He can't know.
If he knows, then they know.

476
00:32:17,914 --> 00:32:20,348
- You could reason with him.
- You don't know him.

477
00:32:20,448 --> 00:32:22,118
He's a fanatic.

478
00:32:22,551 --> 00:32:24,153
It took him three weeks
to get over the fact

479
00:32:24,253 --> 00:32:26,022
that his grandfather
was not blond.

480
00:32:27,223 --> 00:32:28,925
I know he's in there
somewhere.

481
00:32:29,825 --> 00:32:32,594
The little boy who loves to
play and runs to you

482
00:32:32,694 --> 00:32:34,496
because he's scared
of thunder.

483
00:32:34,596 --> 00:32:36,832
Thinks you invented
chocolate cake.

484
00:32:39,467 --> 00:32:41,636
In the end,
that's all you have.

485
00:32:42,804 --> 00:32:43,872
Hope...

486
00:32:44,307 --> 00:32:47,676
that your only remaining child
is not just another ghost.

487
00:32:48,911 --> 00:32:52,014
Perhaps we're all ghosts now.
We just don't know it.

488
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:54,583
Perhaps.

489
00:32:56,384 --> 00:32:58,787
You've lived
more lifetimes than most.

490
00:33:00,488 --> 00:33:02,357
I haven't lived at all.

491
00:33:04,492 --> 00:33:06,062
You're being challenged.

492
00:33:06,929 --> 00:33:09,865
They say you can't live,
that you won't live.

493
00:33:09,966 --> 00:33:11,633
If that comes true,
then they win.

494
00:33:11,733 --> 00:33:13,368
They've been winning so far.

495
00:33:14,569 --> 00:33:16,805
They'll never win.
That's the power you have.

496
00:33:16,906 --> 00:33:20,442
As long as there's someone
alive, somewhere, then they lose.

497
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:24,013
They didn't get you yesterday or today.
You make tomorrow the same.

498
00:33:27,415 --> 00:33:28,650
Hey.

499
00:33:29,684 --> 00:33:31,419
Tomorrow must be the same.

500
00:34:01,984 --> 00:34:03,352
Jesus Christ!

501
00:34:03,451 --> 00:34:04,719
You must stretch.

502
00:34:04,819 --> 00:34:05,922
Does that hurt you?

503
00:34:06,022 --> 00:34:08,556
- Yes.
- Good. Pain is your friend.

504
00:34:08,657 --> 00:34:10,425
Soon your leg will only be

505
00:34:10,525 --> 00:34:12,228
a little bit deformed
and pointless.

506
00:34:12,328 --> 00:34:14,863
I'm going to recommend another
month off school though

507
00:34:14,964 --> 00:34:17,499
because your face
might scare the other kids.

508
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,335
It's kind of ugly.

509
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:21,636
Okay, who's next?

510
00:34:26,242 --> 00:34:27,376
Jojo.

511
00:34:27,475 --> 00:34:28,978
Baby, I have to go.

512
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,516
I'll see you at home. Mmm.

513
00:34:41,157 --> 00:34:42,824
- Hi, Captain K.
- Hey.

514
00:34:42,925 --> 00:34:44,260
If it isn't
<i>Herr</i> Hand Grenade himself.

515
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,328
Ah.

516
00:34:45,428 --> 00:34:47,462
How's the leg, kid?

517
00:34:47,562 --> 00:34:49,265
It's pretty much healed.

518
00:34:49,365 --> 00:34:51,666
It only 80% hurts now.

519
00:34:51,766 --> 00:34:53,369
What are you guys doing?

520
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:55,237
I'm being made
to teach the HJ boys

521
00:34:55,338 --> 00:34:57,206
water warfare training.

522
00:34:57,306 --> 00:34:58,773
You know, in case
they ever need

523
00:34:58,873 --> 00:35:00,876
to go to battle
in a swimming pool.

524
00:35:04,347 --> 00:35:06,415
Can I ask you
a question about Jews?

525
00:35:06,514 --> 00:35:08,750
Oh, God. Why?

526
00:35:10,852 --> 00:35:12,620
What should I do if I see one?

527
00:35:12,721 --> 00:35:13,755
Ugh. Okay.

528
00:35:13,855 --> 00:35:16,524
If you see a Jew, you tell us,

529
00:35:16,624 --> 00:35:18,626
we tell the Gestapo,
and they tell the SS,

530
00:35:18,727 --> 00:35:20,429
and then they go
and they kill the Jew.

531
00:35:20,896 --> 00:35:22,497
And anyone
who helped the Jew.

532
00:35:22,764 --> 00:35:25,067
And because these are very
paranoid times,

533
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:27,269
probably some
other people just in case.

534
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,770
It's a pretty drawn out
process.

535
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:32,208
Even if the Jew
hypnotized someone

536
00:35:32,308 --> 00:35:34,377
to make them hide
the Jew in the first place?

537
00:35:34,477 --> 00:35:36,112
I'd be amazed
if that could happen.

538
00:35:36,212 --> 00:35:37,779
No, it can happen.

539
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:44,719
It happened to my uncle.

540
00:35:44,819 --> 00:35:46,422
A Jew hypnotized him

541
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:49,425
and he became a massive
drunk and a gambler.

542
00:35:49,524 --> 00:35:51,027
And he cheated on his wife

543
00:35:51,127 --> 00:35:54,662
and he had an inappropriate
relationship with my sister.

544
00:35:54,763 --> 00:35:57,665
And then he drowned
in an unrelated accident,

545
00:35:57,766 --> 00:36:00,136
but it was the Jew's fault.

546
00:36:00,236 --> 00:36:02,570
Anyway. Did you see one?
A Jew.

547
00:36:03,772 --> 00:36:07,209
- I'm not sure I'd be able to tell if I did.
- Yeah, me neither.

548
00:36:07,309 --> 00:36:09,577
Without their funny hats,
it's damn near impossible.

549
00:36:09,879 --> 00:36:11,713
Someone should write a book
on the subject.

550
00:36:11,813 --> 00:36:13,182
It would make
things so much easier.

551
00:36:13,282 --> 00:36:15,317
- It would be a hit.
- <i>Ja.</i>

552
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,255
Finkie, they're drowning.
Come on.

553
00:36:20,555 --> 00:36:21,589
I'll see you later,
little man.

554
00:36:41,377 --> 00:36:44,246
Okay, here's the situation.

555
00:36:45,014 --> 00:36:47,983
If I tell on you,
you'll be in big trouble,

556
00:36:48,084 --> 00:36:50,119
and I don't think
you want that.

557
00:36:50,219 --> 00:36:53,222
But then you'll tell on me and my
mother, and we'll be in trouble,

558
00:36:53,322 --> 00:36:54,856
which I don't want.

559
00:36:54,957 --> 00:36:58,360
And if you tell my mother I
know, then she'll kick you out,

560
00:36:58,461 --> 00:37:00,229
which you don't want.

561
00:37:00,329 --> 00:37:02,797
And if I tell my mother
I know,

562
00:37:02,898 --> 00:37:05,700
then you'll
cut off my Nazi head,

563
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,903
which I also don't want.

564
00:37:09,405 --> 00:37:11,440
So, it's a Mexican stalemate.

565
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,309
It's just a normal stalemate.

566
00:37:13,409 --> 00:37:15,878
I have some conditions
for allowing you to stay here.

567
00:37:15,978 --> 00:37:17,712
- "Conditions?"
- Yes.

568
00:37:17,812 --> 00:37:21,616
Tell me everything
about the Jewish race.

569
00:37:22,118 --> 00:37:23,152
Okay.

570
00:37:24,786 --> 00:37:26,122
We're like you,

571
00:37:27,655 --> 00:37:28,656
but human.

572
00:37:28,756 --> 00:37:30,859
Please take this seriously.

573
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,329
Think of this as an exposé.

574
00:37:33,429 --> 00:37:35,264
I want to know
all your secrets.

575
00:37:36,098 --> 00:37:38,501
Kindly refrain from sitting
on my sister's bed.

576
00:37:38,601 --> 00:37:40,735
Why? She doesn't need it.

577
00:37:40,835 --> 00:37:42,804
You know nothing of my sister.

578
00:37:42,905 --> 00:37:44,373
Inge and I were friends.

579
00:37:45,207 --> 00:37:46,641
I remember you.

580
00:37:46,741 --> 00:37:48,743
Such a funny little boy.

581
00:37:48,843 --> 00:37:50,812
Enough with the small talk.

582
00:37:50,913 --> 00:37:53,215
Start telling me
about your kind.

583
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:57,319
Obviously, we are demons
who love money.

584
00:37:57,419 --> 00:37:58,454
Right?

585
00:37:58,554 --> 00:38:00,356
Obviously.
Everyone knows that.

586
00:38:00,456 --> 00:38:04,692
But what people don't know is
that we're also allergic to food.

587
00:38:04,792 --> 00:38:07,363
Cheese, bread, meat.

588
00:38:07,463 --> 00:38:08,931
That stuff
will kill us instantly.

589
00:38:09,031 --> 00:38:11,733
So, if you're thinking
of ending my life,

590
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:13,602
that's the fastest way.

591
00:38:13,701 --> 00:38:15,670
Also biscuits, lethal.

592
00:38:18,174 --> 00:38:19,642
Very funny.

593
00:38:20,075 --> 00:38:22,011
Anyway, there's not enough
food for you,

594
00:38:22,111 --> 00:38:23,646
so I don't know
what you're going to do.

595
00:38:23,745 --> 00:38:26,582
Your mother managed
to find me some bread.

596
00:38:26,681 --> 00:38:29,851
She's kind.
She treats me like a person.

597
00:38:29,952 --> 00:38:32,188
But you're not.
Not a proper person.

598
00:38:32,288 --> 00:38:33,788
Are you?

599
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,859
How dare you, Jew!

600
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,530
You are weak like an eyelash.

601
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:44,266
I am born of Aryan ancestry.

602
00:38:44,366 --> 00:38:48,037
My blood is the color
of a pure red rose.

603
00:38:48,137 --> 00:38:50,105
And my eyes are blue like...

604
00:38:51,473 --> 00:38:52,641
Break free.

605
00:38:53,309 --> 00:38:57,646
Break free, great Aryan.
There are no weak Jews.

606
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:01,483
I am descended from those who
wrestle angels and kill giants.

607
00:39:01,584 --> 00:39:03,586
We were chosen by God.

608
00:39:04,253 --> 00:39:06,488
You were chosen by a
pathetic little man

609
00:39:06,589 --> 00:39:08,490
who can't even grow
a full mustache.

610
00:39:10,725 --> 00:39:12,127
The stronger race, huh?

611
00:39:20,035 --> 00:39:23,572
So, how's it all going
with that Jew thing upstairs?

612
00:39:23,672 --> 00:39:25,641
Well, she doesn't want
to talk to me.

613
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,710
Mm-hmm. Well, you are a Nazi.

614
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:29,311
I guess.

615
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:31,981
This book is going to be
harder to write than I thought.

616
00:39:32,081 --> 00:39:34,116
Hmm.

617
00:39:36,952 --> 00:39:39,787
What's she doing?
She's burning something.

618
00:39:39,888 --> 00:39:41,323
What is she burning?

619
00:39:41,423 --> 00:39:43,892
- What are you burning?
- She can't hear you.

620
00:39:43,993 --> 00:39:46,028
What are you burning?

621
00:39:57,473 --> 00:39:58,607
Why so happy?

622
00:39:58,707 --> 00:39:59,942
Things are changing.

623
00:40:00,042 --> 00:40:01,377
The Allies have taken Italy.

624
00:40:01,477 --> 00:40:03,845
France will be next
and soon the war will be over.

625
00:40:03,946 --> 00:40:06,915
Goddamn it!
Why does that make you happy?

626
00:40:07,016 --> 00:40:08,350
You hate your country
that much?

627
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:10,486
I love my country.
It's the war I hate.

628
00:40:10,586 --> 00:40:12,054
It's pointless and stupid,

629
00:40:12,154 --> 00:40:13,788
and the sooner
we have peace, the better.

630
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:15,257
Oh, the war will end.

631
00:40:15,357 --> 00:40:17,960
We will crush our enemies
into dust.

632
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,495
And when they
are destroyed,

633
00:40:19,595 --> 00:40:20,963
we shall use
their graves as toilets.

634
00:40:21,063 --> 00:40:22,931
Okay. No more politics.

635
00:40:23,032 --> 00:40:25,401
Dinner is neutral ground.
This table is Switzerland.

636
00:40:25,501 --> 00:40:26,902
Let's eat.

637
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,046
You aren't eating.

638
00:40:38,147 --> 00:40:40,783
No. I am not that hungry.

639
00:40:40,883 --> 00:40:42,384
I might eat later.

640
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:45,254
For now, I am just going to
chew on these grapes.

641
00:40:48,691 --> 00:40:51,527
Well, I'm especially hungry
tonight.

642
00:40:51,627 --> 00:40:54,963
So maybe
I'll just finish yours.

643
00:40:55,064 --> 00:40:56,831
Don't want it to go to waste.

644
00:41:11,647 --> 00:41:13,082
How was your day, Johannes?

645
00:41:13,182 --> 00:41:15,517
Oh, you know,
just wandered around,

646
00:41:15,617 --> 00:41:17,820
being a deformed kid
with nothing to live for.

647
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,188
You're not deformed.

648
00:41:19,288 --> 00:41:23,258
My face looks like
a goddamn street map, woman.

649
00:41:24,293 --> 00:41:26,562
I wouldn't expect you
to understand.

650
00:41:26,662 --> 00:41:28,997
If my father were here,
he'd get it.

651
00:41:29,098 --> 00:41:30,799
Well, he's not.

652
00:41:30,899 --> 00:41:35,137
I know. And instead,
I'm stuck with you.

653
00:41:36,038 --> 00:41:37,306
You want your dad, 'eh?

654
00:41:37,406 --> 00:41:38,173
Yeah, I do.

655
00:41:38,273 --> 00:41:40,409
- Yeah? Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.

656
00:41:40,509 --> 00:41:41,577
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

657
00:41:41,677 --> 00:41:42,978
Fine.

658
00:41:55,124 --> 00:41:56,658
Don't you ever talk

659
00:41:56,759 --> 00:41:58,427
to your goddamn mother
like that!

660
00:42:15,344 --> 00:42:17,212
Paul, what happened?

661
00:42:18,647 --> 00:42:19,681
Paul?

662
00:42:19,782 --> 00:42:21,083
I yelled at the kid.

663
00:42:21,183 --> 00:42:23,585
What? Go apologize.

664
00:42:26,922 --> 00:42:27,891
Sorry, kid.

665
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:29,191
What?

666
00:42:29,291 --> 00:42:31,160
What kind of apology was that?

667
00:42:40,269 --> 00:42:41,603
Sorry, kid.

668
00:42:45,774 --> 00:42:47,042
Jojo...

669
00:42:48,243 --> 00:42:50,612
I know you miss me,
but I'm...

670
00:42:50,712 --> 00:42:54,149
I'm out there trying to make
a difference in the world.

671
00:42:54,516 --> 00:42:55,751
And while I'm gone,

672
00:42:56,518 --> 00:42:59,455
I need you
to take care of my Rosie.

673
00:43:00,823 --> 00:43:02,090
Can you do that?

674
00:43:04,726 --> 00:43:06,195
Yes, Dad.

675
00:43:06,695 --> 00:43:07,729
Thanks.

676
00:43:09,331 --> 00:43:10,732
She's doing what she can.

677
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:16,472
Oh, gosh.
We made a good kid, huh?

678
00:43:17,606 --> 00:43:20,242
Mm-mm! Damn, that's good.

679
00:43:20,342 --> 00:43:24,012
It reminds me of dancing
with Rosie in The Red Salon.

680
00:43:24,112 --> 00:43:26,181
You remember, honey?

681
00:43:26,281 --> 00:43:28,016
Of course I do, babe.

682
00:43:36,325 --> 00:43:39,828
Hey,
don't just sit there, kid.

683
00:43:39,929 --> 00:43:40,897
Come.

684
00:43:40,996 --> 00:43:42,631
Dance with your parents, come.

685
00:44:30,245 --> 00:44:34,049
So, I'd like you to draw
a picture of where Jews live.

686
00:44:34,149 --> 00:44:36,385
Where you all eat, sleep,

687
00:44:36,485 --> 00:44:38,754
and where the queen Jew
lays the eggs.

688
00:44:39,121 --> 00:44:40,455
You really are an idiot.

689
00:44:40,556 --> 00:44:42,357
Come on.
We have a lot of work to do.

690
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:44,793
Tell me about your family.

691
00:44:44,894 --> 00:44:46,228
I'll tell you about the Jews,

692
00:44:46,328 --> 00:44:47,997
but you are not privileged
to know about my family.

693
00:44:48,096 --> 00:44:49,498
But I need background.

694
00:44:49,598 --> 00:44:51,901
Why are you
hanging around with me?

695
00:44:52,001 --> 00:44:53,135
Don't you have any friends?

696
00:44:53,235 --> 00:44:54,836
Of course. Yorki.

697
00:44:54,938 --> 00:44:56,338
- "Yorki?"
- Amongst others.

698
00:44:56,438 --> 00:44:58,908
Well, you don't have anyone.

699
00:44:59,008 --> 00:45:00,142
I have Nathan.

700
00:45:00,242 --> 00:45:02,177
"Nathan?"
Who the hell is that?

701
00:45:02,277 --> 00:45:05,247
- My fiancé. I have him.
- Where is he?

702
00:45:05,347 --> 00:45:07,849
Fighting in
the resistance, see.

703
00:45:09,851 --> 00:45:12,321
He proposed to me
on the banks of the <i>Fluß.</i>

704
00:45:12,421 --> 00:45:16,558
He knelt down like a proper
gentleman, recited a poem by Rilke.

705
00:45:16,658 --> 00:45:19,494
And when I said yes,
we danced into the night.

706
00:45:19,595 --> 00:45:21,163
Snore.

707
00:45:21,263 --> 00:45:22,297
Who's Rilke?

708
00:45:22,397 --> 00:45:24,299
A great poet.
Nathan's favorite.

709
00:45:24,399 --> 00:45:25,867
Oh, Nathan's favorite? Yay.

710
00:45:25,969 --> 00:45:28,938
He's coming to rescue me,
then we'll go live in Paris.

711
00:45:29,504 --> 00:45:31,773
You'd turn your back
on Germany forever?

712
00:45:32,274 --> 00:45:33,842
It turned on me first.

713
00:45:33,943 --> 00:45:35,544
Well, we don't need you.

714
00:45:35,644 --> 00:45:37,713
You and your stupid boyfriend
can shut up

715
00:45:37,813 --> 00:45:42,584
and go live in damn
cheese, snail, baguette land.

716
00:45:42,952 --> 00:45:45,287
Now, now, just because
you don't have a girlfriend.

717
00:45:45,387 --> 00:45:47,090
I'm way too
busy for a girlfriend.

718
00:45:47,189 --> 00:45:49,324
One day, you'll make time.

719
00:45:49,424 --> 00:45:51,560
You'll think of nothing else.

720
00:45:52,127 --> 00:45:54,596
You'll meet someone
and spend your days

721
00:45:54,696 --> 00:45:58,133
dreaming of the moment you can
hold them in your arms again.

722
00:45:59,301 --> 00:46:00,535
That's love.

723
00:46:02,838 --> 00:46:04,740
- Ridiculous.
- Finished.

724
00:46:14,917 --> 00:46:17,252
I said to draw
where Jews live.

725
00:46:17,352 --> 00:46:20,056
This is just a stupid picture
of my head.

726
00:46:20,455 --> 00:46:22,524
Yeah. That's where we live.

727
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:31,366
Rilke, Rilke, Rilke.

728
00:46:31,466 --> 00:46:34,703
Where are you?
Poetry-writing dumbhead.

729
00:46:34,803 --> 00:46:35,804
Ah.

730
00:46:35,905 --> 00:46:38,007
Yes. Great thinking, Rabbit.

731
00:46:38,107 --> 00:46:41,276
We'll use all of these books to make
a fake floor that she'll fall through.

732
00:46:41,376 --> 00:46:43,845
Straight into
a pit full of piranhas

733
00:46:43,946 --> 00:46:46,648
and... and lava
and bacon.

734
00:46:46,916 --> 00:46:48,817
- Why, she won't know what hit her.
- Shh!

735
00:46:48,918 --> 00:46:50,153
- Shh?
- Shh!

736
00:46:50,252 --> 00:46:51,753
You shush. Shush me?

737
00:46:51,853 --> 00:46:54,389
Let's get a book and let's go.
Libraries are dumb.

738
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,597
Yeah, this is a really good
idea, what we're doing right now.

739
00:47:02,698 --> 00:47:06,568
If she had a heart, this would
break it clean in two.

740
00:47:09,138 --> 00:47:10,806
I have something to tell you.

741
00:47:10,907 --> 00:47:14,944
I came across
an old letter from Nathan,

742
00:47:15,044 --> 00:47:17,080
your fiancé, addressed to you.

743
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:20,482
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I'll just read it.

744
00:47:22,118 --> 00:47:25,787
"Dear Elsa, this is hard
for me to say,

745
00:47:25,888 --> 00:47:28,824
"but I don't want
to marry you anymore.

746
00:47:29,691 --> 00:47:32,227
"I found a new woman
and we laugh a lot

747
00:47:32,327 --> 00:47:34,063
"and do the tongue-kiss.

748
00:47:34,163 --> 00:47:36,531
"It's like my favorite poet,
Rilke, says,

749
00:47:36,631 --> 00:47:41,837
"'We need in love to practice
only this: letting each other go.'

750
00:47:42,304 --> 00:47:45,007
"So, goodbye and sorry
about letting you go.

751
00:47:45,108 --> 00:47:48,911
"From Nathan, your ex-fiancé.

752
00:47:49,311 --> 00:47:52,115
"PS, I'm not really
in the resistance.

753
00:47:52,215 --> 00:47:53,281
"I was lying.

754
00:47:53,381 --> 00:47:56,251
I'm unemployed
and quite fat now."

755
00:48:21,911 --> 00:48:24,813
Um... don't open the door,

756
00:48:24,914 --> 00:48:29,584
but I actually forgot
there was a second letter.

757
00:48:30,052 --> 00:48:33,222
"Dear Elsa...

758
00:48:33,321 --> 00:48:37,994
"I just wanted to let you know that I
don't want to break up with you now.

759
00:48:38,094 --> 00:48:42,265
"I changed my mind because I don't
want you to kill yourself over me,

760
00:48:42,364 --> 00:48:44,599
"which a couple of girls
have done in the past,

761
00:48:44,699 --> 00:48:46,868
"and it's pretty stressful.

762
00:48:46,969 --> 00:48:48,603
"I need you to stay alive.

763
00:48:48,703 --> 00:48:50,973
"Thank God you're being
taken care of by that kid

764
00:48:51,073 --> 00:48:55,343
"who I must say is a remarkable
young man beyond his years.

765
00:48:55,443 --> 00:48:56,711
"And brave, too.

766
00:48:56,812 --> 00:48:58,780
"And let's still
get married sometime,

767
00:48:58,881 --> 00:49:00,715
"even though
I am truly unemployed

768
00:49:00,816 --> 00:49:02,717
"and have nothing
going on for me.

769
00:49:03,752 --> 00:49:06,889
Yours, Nathan."

770
00:49:15,397 --> 00:49:16,865
- Beethoven.
- Einstein.

771
00:49:16,966 --> 00:49:18,234
- Bach.
- Gershwin.

772
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:20,236
Brahms. Wagner. Mozart.

773
00:49:20,335 --> 00:49:21,904
Musicians,
is that all you have?

774
00:49:22,004 --> 00:49:22,972
Rilke.

775
00:49:23,072 --> 00:49:24,372
Oh, yeah, of course.

776
00:49:24,472 --> 00:49:26,775
Your favorite, Rilke.
Jewish mother.

777
00:49:26,876 --> 00:49:27,843
Dietrich, then.

778
00:49:27,944 --> 00:49:29,477
Houdini.

779
00:49:29,845 --> 00:49:32,882
- No. That's impossible.
- Believe it, brother.

780
00:49:32,982 --> 00:49:35,918
Just ask Pissarro, Modigliani,
Man Ray, Gertrude Stein,

781
00:49:36,018 --> 00:49:39,688
Mr. Moses and the king of them
all, Jesus Christi. Amen.

782
00:49:39,788 --> 00:49:40,789
Pew, pew, pew!

783
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:42,591
Well, you're just saying
any old name now.

784
00:49:42,691 --> 00:49:45,694
I've never heard of these
people and now I'm fed up.

785
00:49:45,794 --> 00:49:46,862
Hey.

786
00:49:46,963 --> 00:49:48,530
If you find any more
of those letters,

787
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:49,999
will you let me know?

788
00:49:50,266 --> 00:49:51,300
Sure.

789
00:49:51,399 --> 00:49:52,834
Okay.

790
00:49:52,935 --> 00:49:53,970
Bye.

791
00:49:56,671 --> 00:49:59,741
Ah, these banks
used to be full of lovers.

792
00:50:00,508 --> 00:50:03,012
There was dancing and singing.

793
00:50:04,146 --> 00:50:06,115
Romance.

794
00:50:06,215 --> 00:50:08,217
There's no time for romance.

795
00:50:08,317 --> 00:50:09,484
We're at war.

796
00:50:09,584 --> 00:50:12,487
Oh.
There's always time for romance.

797
00:50:12,989 --> 00:50:15,624
Someday you'll meet
someone special.

798
00:50:15,724 --> 00:50:18,027
Why does everyone
keep telling me that?

799
00:50:18,995 --> 00:50:20,595
Who else tells you that?

800
00:50:21,496 --> 00:50:23,232
Everyone.

801
00:50:23,332 --> 00:50:24,532
Anyway.

802
00:50:24,633 --> 00:50:26,035
It's a stupid idea.

803
00:50:26,135 --> 00:50:28,637
You're stupid.

804
00:50:28,737 --> 00:50:30,973
Love is the strongest thing
in the world.

805
00:50:31,073 --> 00:50:34,476
I think you'll find that metal is
the strongest thing in the world.

806
00:50:34,576 --> 00:50:37,380
Followed closely by dynamite,
and then muscles.

807
00:50:38,147 --> 00:50:41,483
Besides, I wouldn't
even know it if I saw it.

808
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:43,518
Surprise, surprise.

809
00:50:43,618 --> 00:50:45,754
Your shoelaces
are undone again.

810
00:50:47,924 --> 00:50:49,091
Oh, Jojo.

811
00:50:49,191 --> 00:50:51,093
You'll know when it happens.

812
00:50:52,161 --> 00:50:53,963
You'll feel it.

813
00:50:54,063 --> 00:50:55,164
It's a pain.

814
00:50:55,597 --> 00:50:57,532
- In my arse, I bet.
- In your tummy.

815
00:50:57,632 --> 00:51:00,435
Like, like, you're
full of butterflies.

816
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:03,205
- Yuck.
- Yeah, "yuck."

817
00:51:04,106 --> 00:51:06,976
Come on, Shitler.
Let's get a move on.

818
00:51:08,177 --> 00:51:09,711
Whoa!

819
00:51:09,811 --> 00:51:11,613
- Hey!
- What's wrong with you?

820
00:51:11,713 --> 00:51:14,951
I'm worried about you, man.
Are you drunk? Again?

821
00:51:15,051 --> 00:51:16,218
Come on. Oh, God.

822
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:17,954
Could you
please untie them?

823
00:51:18,054 --> 00:51:20,122
- You're really getting fat.
- I'm not...

824
00:51:20,222 --> 00:51:22,791
You know what?
Why don't I just leave you here, okay?

825
00:51:22,892 --> 00:51:24,592
- No.
- I'll come and get you tomorrow.

826
00:51:24,693 --> 00:51:26,362
- Okay? How about that?
- No. Mama, Mama!

827
00:51:26,461 --> 00:51:27,629
You'll figure it out, darling.

828
00:51:27,729 --> 00:51:29,098
- No!
- I'll meet you back at the house.

829
00:51:29,198 --> 00:51:31,800
- I'll see you tomorrow morning.
- Mama, Mama!

830
00:51:32,268 --> 00:51:33,903
You're growing up too fast.

831
00:51:34,003 --> 00:51:37,772
Ten-year-olds shouldn't be
celebrating war and talking politics.

832
00:51:37,872 --> 00:51:40,575
You should be
climbing trees

833
00:51:40,675 --> 00:51:42,777
and then falling out of
those trees.

834
00:51:42,878 --> 00:51:44,713
But the <i>Führer</i> says
when we win

835
00:51:44,813 --> 00:51:47,749
it is us, young boys
who will rule the world.

836
00:51:47,849 --> 00:51:48,884
Pfft!

837
00:51:50,086 --> 00:51:51,619
The <i>Reich</i> is dying.

838
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:52,888
We're going to lose the war

839
00:51:52,989 --> 00:51:55,523
and then what are you
going to do, hmm?

840
00:51:55,623 --> 00:51:57,126
Life is a gift.

841
00:51:57,226 --> 00:51:59,295
We must celebrate it.

842
00:51:59,395 --> 00:52:04,000
We have to dance to show God
we are grateful to be alive.

843
00:52:10,339 --> 00:52:12,141
Well, I won't dance.

844
00:52:12,241 --> 00:52:14,542
Dancing is for people
who don't have a job.

845
00:52:14,642 --> 00:52:16,578
Dancing is for people
who are free.

846
00:52:16,678 --> 00:52:18,513
It's an escape from all this.

847
00:52:18,613 --> 00:52:21,384
Well, you're free
to dance your way home.

848
00:52:21,484 --> 00:52:23,085
I'll ride.

849
00:52:23,185 --> 00:52:24,220
Oh, no, you don't.

850
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,687
No one can stop me.

851
00:52:45,307 --> 00:52:46,942
Welcome home, boys!

852
00:52:47,043 --> 00:52:49,145
Now, go home
and kiss your mothers!

853
00:53:09,165 --> 00:53:11,500
No news from Nathan today,
I'm afraid.

854
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:13,601
He's probably doing
something amazing,

855
00:53:13,701 --> 00:53:16,072
like reading a book
or growing a beard.

856
00:53:19,641 --> 00:53:20,943
What's wrong?

857
00:53:23,711 --> 00:53:25,713
You want me to tell you
about the Jews?

858
00:53:26,382 --> 00:53:27,682
Don't care.

859
00:53:28,951 --> 00:53:31,719
In the beginning,
we used to live in caves.

860
00:53:32,188 --> 00:53:34,689
- Deep, deep in the center of the Earth.
- Wait.

861
00:53:34,789 --> 00:53:38,693
Scary places full of strange
and wonderful creatures

862
00:53:38,793 --> 00:53:40,362
all with one thing
in common.

863
00:53:40,463 --> 00:53:42,597
Mm-hmm. Stealing
the ends of penises?

864
00:53:42,697 --> 00:53:44,567
No, you idiot.

865
00:53:44,666 --> 00:53:46,969
- The love of art.
- No cutting penises off?

866
00:53:47,069 --> 00:53:48,437
Do you want
the story or not?

867
00:53:48,537 --> 00:53:50,973
You may continue,
but I know it's true.

868
00:53:51,073 --> 00:53:51,974
The penis thing.

869
00:53:52,074 --> 00:53:54,143
Rabbis use them for earplugs.

870
00:53:54,243 --> 00:53:55,743
And moving on.

871
00:53:55,844 --> 00:53:59,115
After many years of developing
magic and spells,

872
00:53:59,215 --> 00:54:03,152
we slowly moved out of
the caves and into the towns.

873
00:54:03,252 --> 00:54:06,754
Some of us stayed in the caves,
though, in animal bodies.

874
00:54:06,855 --> 00:54:09,592
Which are blobs or something?

875
00:54:09,691 --> 00:54:11,227
Well, I'll draw them for you.

876
00:54:24,672 --> 00:54:26,108
There.

877
00:54:26,741 --> 00:54:28,577
It'd be better with color.

878
00:54:28,878 --> 00:54:30,212
Where's the horns?

879
00:54:30,312 --> 00:54:31,347
Under the hair.

880
00:54:32,814 --> 00:54:34,250
Where's yours?

881
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:35,650
I'm too young.

882
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:38,354
- They grow when you turn 21.
- Oh.

883
00:54:38,454 --> 00:54:40,990
These days we live
among normal people,

884
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:43,192
but often we take over
a house

885
00:54:43,292 --> 00:54:46,061
and hang from
the ceiling when we sleep.

886
00:54:46,162 --> 00:54:47,329
Like bats.

887
00:54:47,762 --> 00:54:49,764
Oh, and another thing is

888
00:54:49,864 --> 00:54:51,333
we can read
each other's minds.

889
00:54:51,433 --> 00:54:53,269
Oh, my God.

890
00:54:53,369 --> 00:54:54,603
Everyone's minds?

891
00:54:54,702 --> 00:54:57,039
- What about German minds?
- No.

892
00:54:57,139 --> 00:54:59,707
Their heads are too thick
for us to penetrate.

893
00:55:00,476 --> 00:55:04,880
Like birds, our true language
sounds like singing.

894
00:55:05,981 --> 00:55:09,618
And we're also attracted
to shiny things.

895
00:55:09,952 --> 00:55:14,356
Crystals, glass and gold.

896
00:55:14,456 --> 00:55:18,294
"Attracted to shiny things."

897
00:55:19,495 --> 00:55:20,663
But also ugly things.

898
00:55:20,762 --> 00:55:22,264
Jews love ugliness.

899
00:55:22,364 --> 00:55:25,134
That's another thing
we learned at school.

900
00:55:25,234 --> 00:55:27,136
You love them, yes?

901
00:55:27,236 --> 00:55:28,270
Ugly things.

902
00:55:35,311 --> 00:55:36,445
Hi.

903
00:55:36,545 --> 00:55:38,447
You two seem to be
getting on well.

904
00:55:38,813 --> 00:55:40,883
I was just making sure
she was still alive.

905
00:55:40,983 --> 00:55:42,384
- What do you care?
- I don't.

906
00:55:42,484 --> 00:55:45,554
I just don't want
a dead person in my house.

907
00:55:45,654 --> 00:55:47,789
- How would you like it?
- I'd love it.

908
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:49,558
More dead people
in my house, please.

909
00:55:49,658 --> 00:55:51,894
Look, just all the time
you two are spending together,

910
00:55:51,994 --> 00:55:53,996
it's making me feel
very uncomfortable.

911
00:55:54,096 --> 00:55:55,998
You suggested it
in the first place.

912
00:55:56,098 --> 00:55:56,899
Did I?

913
00:55:56,999 --> 00:55:58,567
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, I did.

914
00:55:58,667 --> 00:56:01,769
Besides, it's for the book.

915
00:56:02,438 --> 00:56:03,771
Oh, God, you're right.

916
00:56:03,871 --> 00:56:05,474
I'm sorry.
Did I make it weird?

917
00:56:05,574 --> 00:56:06,909
It's weird now, isn't it?

918
00:56:07,009 --> 00:56:09,011
It shouldn't be weird
between us.

919
00:56:09,111 --> 00:56:11,813
None of this should be weird.

920
00:56:11,914 --> 00:56:14,083
It's fine. I'm just tired.
I'm going to bed.

921
00:56:14,183 --> 00:56:16,051
<i>Ja,</i> I was just keeping
your bed warm for you.

922
00:56:16,151 --> 00:56:18,554
'Cause that's
what real friends do.

923
00:56:18,654 --> 00:56:20,623
Hey, what do think
about this uniform?

924
00:56:20,723 --> 00:56:22,424
I'm not sure
about the hips on the pants.

925
00:56:22,524 --> 00:56:23,959
Should they be bigger?

926
00:56:24,493 --> 00:56:26,395
- You look great.
- Thank you.

927
00:56:26,495 --> 00:56:29,932
Now, listen, Jojo.
Can I give you some really good advice?

928
00:56:30,232 --> 00:56:32,034
When you see
what's in her mind

929
00:56:32,134 --> 00:56:34,769
and where she's trying
to make you go in your mind,

930
00:56:34,869 --> 00:56:38,274
in your mind,
you must go the other way.

931
00:56:38,374 --> 00:56:39,575
Get what I'm saying?

932
00:56:39,774 --> 00:56:41,809
Do not let her put you
in a brain prison.

933
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:43,145
That, dear Jojo,

934
00:56:43,245 --> 00:56:46,682
is one thing that cannot
and must not ever,

935
00:56:46,781 --> 00:56:48,984
ever happen to a German!

936
00:56:49,084 --> 00:56:53,355
Do not let your German brain
be bossed around!

937
00:56:53,455 --> 00:56:57,293
I won't let her boss my German
brain around, <i>mein Führer.</i>

938
00:56:57,393 --> 00:56:58,627
Try not to.

939
00:56:59,728 --> 00:57:03,966
Now, I think you've got a lot of
good information in your book.

940
00:57:04,066 --> 00:57:06,568
It's time to show it
to the world, don't you think?

941
00:57:07,403 --> 00:57:08,437
<i>Ja.</i>

942
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:13,609
- Adolf?
- Hmm?

943
00:57:13,709 --> 00:57:15,277
Do you think I'm ugly?

944
00:57:16,278 --> 00:57:17,379
Yes.

945
00:57:26,422 --> 00:57:27,990
Is he asleep?

946
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:29,625
Mmm.

947
00:57:29,725 --> 00:57:30,825
He's different.

948
00:57:31,794 --> 00:57:35,297
He suspects something.
He thinks Inge's ghost lives up here.

949
00:57:38,967 --> 00:57:41,236
You remind me of her.
You really do.

950
00:57:42,471 --> 00:57:45,274
I would love to have seen her
grow into a woman.

951
00:57:47,376 --> 00:57:50,979
But I'll have to
watch you instead.

952
00:57:56,051 --> 00:57:58,454
I don't know anything
about being a woman.

953
00:57:59,955 --> 00:58:01,423
Is that what it is?

954
00:58:02,291 --> 00:58:04,360
You do things like drink wine?

955
00:58:05,994 --> 00:58:08,630
Sure. You drink.

956
00:58:08,731 --> 00:58:10,833
Champagne, if you're happy.

957
00:58:10,966 --> 00:58:12,368
Champagne, if you're sad.

958
00:58:13,502 --> 00:58:15,637
You drive a car.

959
00:58:16,605 --> 00:58:18,407
Gamble if you want.

960
00:58:18,507 --> 00:58:20,008
Own diamonds.

961
00:58:20,109 --> 00:58:21,977
Learn how to fire a gun.

962
00:58:22,077 --> 00:58:23,612
You travel to Morocco.

963
00:58:23,712 --> 00:58:25,381
Take up lovers.

964
00:58:25,481 --> 00:58:27,516
Make them suffer.

965
00:58:27,616 --> 00:58:29,284
You look a tiger in the eye.

966
00:58:30,853 --> 00:58:32,054
And trust without fear.

967
00:58:32,154 --> 00:58:34,323
That's what it is
to be a woman.

968
00:58:35,557 --> 00:58:36,892
How do you do that?

969
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:40,996
How do you know
you can trust someone?

970
00:58:42,097 --> 00:58:43,332
You trust them.

971
00:58:45,701 --> 00:58:46,935
Good night.

972
00:58:50,172 --> 00:58:51,640
All those other things.

973
00:58:52,674 --> 00:58:54,710
Did you do that stuff?

974
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:58,947
You know,
go to Morocco and the rest?

975
00:58:59,848 --> 00:59:00,949
No.

976
00:59:01,049 --> 00:59:03,118
I never looked a tiger
in the eye.

977
00:59:20,969 --> 00:59:24,239
Finkel, I meant we'd need dogs
for when the city is attacked,

978
00:59:24,339 --> 00:59:27,342
not actual German shepherds.

979
00:59:28,777 --> 00:59:30,112
Get them out of here.

980
00:59:30,712 --> 00:59:32,114
Get them out of here!

981
00:59:32,314 --> 00:59:36,051
- Now! Now! Now!
- Move along, please. Move along, please.

982
00:59:36,151 --> 00:59:38,187
Thank you, thank you.

983
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:42,958
- I'm sorry for yelling at you.
- I feel so stupid.

984
00:59:43,058 --> 00:59:45,828
No, no. It's a silly name for a dog.
I should've been more clear.

985
00:59:45,929 --> 00:59:47,963
- You're doing a great job.
- <i>Danke.</i>

986
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:51,967
Hiya, kid.

987
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,969
How can we help you today,
Master Betzler?

988
00:59:54,069 --> 00:59:55,871
What's up? Walk with me.

989
00:59:55,971 --> 00:59:58,807
If someone turned in a Jew,
would they get a medal or something?

990
00:59:58,908 --> 01:00:01,610
Jews, Jews, Jews.
You're still going on about those people?

991
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:04,346
You know I'm preparing the city
for imminent invasion, right?

992
01:00:04,446 --> 01:00:06,682
I'm trying to plan
a defense strategy.

993
01:00:06,782 --> 01:00:08,183
I've got Americans
to the west,

994
01:00:08,283 --> 01:00:09,685
got Russians to the east.

995
01:00:09,785 --> 01:00:13,155
My friend once met some
Russians and they ate him.

996
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:16,024
Who's the walnuts?

997
01:00:16,124 --> 01:00:17,259
Walnuts are just walnuts, kid.

998
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:19,094
What do you want
to talk about?

999
01:00:19,194 --> 01:00:21,363
Well, I am learning
a lot about Jews.

1000
01:00:21,463 --> 01:00:24,399
Did you know Jews
can read each other's minds?

1001
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:27,402
And when they sleep,
they hang from the ceiling, like bats.

1002
01:00:27,503 --> 01:00:31,039
That's fascinating. And where
did you come by this information?

1003
01:00:33,041 --> 01:00:35,177
Research.
I'm writing a book.

1004
01:00:35,277 --> 01:00:37,679
Oh, congratulations.
What's it called?

1005
01:00:37,779 --> 01:00:39,081
<i>Yoohoo Jew.</i>

1006
01:00:39,181 --> 01:00:40,749
It's an exposé on Jews.

1007
01:00:42,384 --> 01:00:45,320
You could also call it
<i>Who Are You, Jew?</i>

1008
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:48,390
Or what about <i>Jews New?</i>

1009
01:00:48,724 --> 01:00:51,460
Oh, you do have a
wonderful imagination on you.

1010
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,930
- But it's real.
- <i>Ja,</i> of course it's real.

1011
01:00:54,029 --> 01:00:57,399
When I was your age,
I had an imaginary friend called Conny.

1012
01:00:57,499 --> 01:00:59,334
He used to wet my bed
when I was asleep.

1013
01:00:59,434 --> 01:01:01,004
He got me in so much trouble.

1014
01:01:01,169 --> 01:01:03,705
Hey, come here. You might like
to check out what I'm working on.

1015
01:01:04,206 --> 01:01:06,341
As part of our preparations
for the invasion,

1016
01:01:06,441 --> 01:01:07,977
I'm redesigning my uniform.

1017
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:10,880
Note, the feathers
for aerodynamics,

1018
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:12,681
the sparkly color
to dazzle the enemy,

1019
01:01:12,781 --> 01:01:14,716
the boots purely decorative.

1020
01:01:14,816 --> 01:01:16,019
And this,

1021
01:01:16,118 --> 01:01:19,354
this is a Gatling gun
mounted with a radio

1022
01:01:19,454 --> 01:01:23,759
which emits annoying music
to dishearten the enemy.

1023
01:01:23,859 --> 01:01:25,694
This is all copyrighted,
by the way.

1024
01:01:25,794 --> 01:01:26,896
That means
you can't copy it.

1025
01:01:26,996 --> 01:01:29,298
<i>Ja.</i> Don't get any ideas, kid.

1026
01:01:31,833 --> 01:01:34,469
The kids tell me that
your father's away fighting.

1027
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:37,639
So it appears you are now the man
of the house. How's that going?

1028
01:01:38,707 --> 01:01:40,142
It's okay.

1029
01:01:40,842 --> 01:01:41,911
<i>Ja?</i>

1030
01:01:42,177 --> 01:01:44,446
So, what jobs
do you have for me today?

1031
01:01:44,546 --> 01:01:46,114
Well, I've got one, I won't lie.

1032
01:01:46,214 --> 01:01:48,183
It's a bit of a step down
from what you're used to,

1033
01:01:48,283 --> 01:01:51,119
but we need all hands on deck
right now.

1034
01:01:52,287 --> 01:01:54,356
Metal for Hitler!

1035
01:01:54,456 --> 01:01:57,392
Pots and pans
for the war effort!

1036
01:01:57,492 --> 01:02:00,095
<i>♪ Here comes the metal man ♪</i>

1037
01:02:00,195 --> 01:02:02,966
<i>♪ Looking for
your pots and pans ♪</i>

1038
01:02:03,066 --> 01:02:05,969
- Metal for Hitler!
- Metal for Hitler!

1039
01:02:06,069 --> 01:02:07,135
Nuts and bolts!

1040
01:02:07,235 --> 01:02:08,570
Pots and pans!

1041
01:02:30,258 --> 01:02:32,394
"Free Germany."

1042
01:02:37,766 --> 01:02:38,800
Jojo?

1043
01:02:40,135 --> 01:02:42,204
- Yorki?
- Hi!

1044
01:02:45,707 --> 01:02:46,943
You're a soldier now?

1045
01:02:47,043 --> 01:02:48,677
At your service.

1046
01:02:48,777 --> 01:02:50,512
But you're only 11.

1047
01:02:50,612 --> 01:02:51,747
I know.

1048
01:02:51,847 --> 01:02:53,682
- May I?
- Yeah, sure.

1049
01:02:53,782 --> 01:02:55,150
Is that paper?

1050
01:02:55,550 --> 01:02:59,154
That's what I thought at first,
too, but it's "paper-like."

1051
01:02:59,254 --> 01:03:00,856
It's the latest material

1052
01:03:00,957 --> 01:03:02,959
invented by
our top scientists.

1053
01:03:03,059 --> 01:03:05,594
Well, I'm impressed.

1054
01:03:06,161 --> 01:03:07,596
Hey, Yorki.

1055
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:11,100
I caught a Jew. A real one.

1056
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:12,801
Oh, a Jew?

1057
01:03:12,902 --> 01:03:14,202
I saw some
that they caught

1058
01:03:14,302 --> 01:03:15,871
hiding in the forest
last month.

1059
01:03:15,972 --> 01:03:18,640
Personally, I didn't see
what all the fuss was about.

1060
01:03:18,941 --> 01:03:22,444
They weren't at all scary
and seemed kind of normal.

1061
01:03:22,544 --> 01:03:24,513
Oh, I'm getting distracted.

1062
01:03:24,613 --> 01:03:26,348
I got to go.

1063
01:03:26,448 --> 01:03:27,749
Bye.

1064
01:03:27,849 --> 01:03:29,052
- Bye.
- Oh, my God.

1065
01:03:29,152 --> 01:03:31,253
It's so hard to run
in this thing.

1066
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:38,393
I found these.

1067
01:03:39,695 --> 01:03:42,264
You can have them.
They're probably broken.

1068
01:03:42,364 --> 01:03:44,266
Doesn't mean anything.

1069
01:03:44,366 --> 01:03:46,668
Maybe you can draw something
for my book.

1070
01:03:49,371 --> 01:03:50,672
I could draw you again.

1071
01:03:50,772 --> 01:03:53,275
No one wants to see
pictures of cripples.

1072
01:03:55,044 --> 01:03:56,578
You're hardly a cripple.

1073
01:03:57,813 --> 01:04:01,717
Besides, true artists
don't see that stuff.

1074
01:04:01,817 --> 01:04:03,351
Blind artists, you mean.

1075
01:04:04,352 --> 01:04:05,487
It's fine.

1076
01:04:05,587 --> 01:04:07,856
I'll just accept I'll be
one of those guys

1077
01:04:07,957 --> 01:04:09,558
who'll never get
to kiss a girl.

1078
01:04:10,459 --> 01:04:11,894
You will be kissed, Jojo.

1079
01:04:14,163 --> 01:04:15,731
Do you want me to kiss you?

1080
01:04:18,968 --> 01:04:20,136
Okay.

1081
01:04:20,235 --> 01:04:22,105
Two things.

1082
01:04:22,205 --> 01:04:23,572
Thing number one:

1083
01:04:23,672 --> 01:04:26,742
It's illegal for Nazis and
Jews to hang out like we do,

1084
01:04:26,842 --> 01:04:28,310
let alone kiss.

1085
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:30,412
Thing number two:

1086
01:04:30,512 --> 01:04:34,516
It'd just be a sympathy kiss,
which doesn't count.

1087
01:04:36,318 --> 01:04:38,020
You're not a Nazi.

1088
01:04:38,121 --> 01:04:39,554
Uh, I'm massively
into swastikas,

1089
01:04:39,654 --> 01:04:41,857
so I think that's a pretty
good sign right there.

1090
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:43,960
You're not a Nazi, Jojo.

1091
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,429
You're a ten-year-old kid
who likes swastikas

1092
01:04:47,529 --> 01:04:49,264
and likes dressing up
in a funny uniform

1093
01:04:49,364 --> 01:04:51,500
and wants to be
part of a club.

1094
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,835
But you are not one of them.

1095
01:04:55,670 --> 01:04:57,272
Okay.

1096
01:04:57,372 --> 01:05:00,275
Let's just agree to disagree.

1097
01:05:00,709 --> 01:05:02,277
All right?

1098
01:05:02,377 --> 01:05:03,612
"Not a Nazi."

1099
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,916
What a dirty Jew.

1100
01:05:57,967 --> 01:05:59,601
Come on. Hide.

1101
01:05:59,701 --> 01:06:00,735
Hurry. Go.

1102
01:06:07,375 --> 01:06:08,911
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1103
01:06:09,477 --> 01:06:10,880
Allow me to introduce myself.

1104
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:13,648
I'm Captain Herman Deertz
of the Falkenheim Gestapo.

1105
01:06:13,748 --> 01:06:15,918
With me, <i>Herr</i> Mueller,
<i>Herr</i> Junker,

1106
01:06:16,018 --> 01:06:18,854
<i>Herr</i> Klum and <i>Herr</i> Frosch.
May we come in?

1107
01:06:20,555 --> 01:06:21,958
Thank you so much.

1108
01:06:22,058 --> 01:06:23,458
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1109
01:06:23,558 --> 01:06:24,693
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1110
01:06:24,793 --> 01:06:26,262
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1111
01:06:26,361 --> 01:06:27,495
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1112
01:06:27,596 --> 01:06:29,098
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1113
01:06:53,356 --> 01:06:55,024
Hey, Jojo!

1114
01:06:55,124 --> 01:06:56,225
Hey, guys!

1115
01:06:56,325 --> 01:06:57,759
Good to see you!

1116
01:06:57,859 --> 01:07:01,063
My bicycle got a flat tire,
so I carried it.

1117
01:07:01,163 --> 01:07:03,632
- Captain Klenzendorf.
<i>Heil</i> Hitler. <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1118
01:07:03,732 --> 01:07:04,799
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1119
01:07:04,901 --> 01:07:06,002
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1120
01:07:06,102 --> 01:07:07,402
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1121
01:07:07,502 --> 01:07:08,503
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1122
01:07:08,603 --> 01:07:10,605
You know Freddy Finkel.

1123
01:07:10,705 --> 01:07:11,740
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1124
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:12,909
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1125
01:07:13,009 --> 01:07:13,943
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1126
01:07:14,043 --> 01:07:14,977
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1127
01:07:15,077 --> 01:07:16,511
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1128
01:07:16,611 --> 01:07:18,381
So, did I miss anything?

1129
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,548
No, no. We were just
<i>Heil</i> Hitlering" the boy

1130
01:07:20,649 --> 01:07:21,984
and then
<i>Heil</i> Hitlering" yourself

1131
01:07:22,084 --> 01:07:24,220
and then, of course,
<i>Heil</i> Hitlering" Freddy Finkel

1132
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:28,423
and now we are in the midst
of a routine inspection.

1133
01:07:28,523 --> 01:07:30,659
And, uh, what brings
you here, Captain?

1134
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:33,528
Oh, we were just passing by

1135
01:07:33,628 --> 01:07:36,865
and we thought we'd drop off
some pamphlets for the boy.

1136
01:07:36,966 --> 01:07:38,566
He works for us.

1137
01:07:40,236 --> 01:07:41,836
- I see.
- <i>Ja.</i>

1138
01:07:41,938 --> 01:07:44,606
- And yourself?
- Oh, you know how it is.

1139
01:07:44,706 --> 01:07:47,276
Every day we take a call.
"Hello, is that the Gestapo?

1140
01:07:47,376 --> 01:07:50,545
I believe there's a Communist
hiding behind my fridge."

1141
01:07:50,645 --> 01:07:53,182
We go around to investigate.
It's just some mold.

1142
01:07:53,515 --> 01:07:54,984
So, not far off.

1143
01:07:55,684 --> 01:07:57,119
It's all part of the job.

1144
01:08:00,022 --> 01:08:01,656
Oh!

1145
01:08:01,756 --> 01:08:04,726
Now this is my kind
of little boy's bedroom.

1146
01:08:05,328 --> 01:08:06,795
Oh, yes.

1147
01:08:06,896 --> 01:08:08,030
There he is.

1148
01:08:08,431 --> 01:08:09,764
You and your friends
may have heard a rumor

1149
01:08:09,864 --> 01:08:11,233
that Hitler only has one ball.

1150
01:08:11,334 --> 01:08:12,534
This is nonsense.

1151
01:08:12,634 --> 01:08:15,104
He has four.

1152
01:08:15,204 --> 01:08:19,507
So, you are volunteering at
the <i>Hitlerjugend</i> office, yes?

1153
01:08:20,076 --> 01:08:21,143
Yes.

1154
01:08:21,243 --> 01:08:22,677
Oh, good for you.

1155
01:08:22,777 --> 01:08:26,514
I wish more of our young boys
had your blind fanaticism.

1156
01:08:28,884 --> 01:08:31,120
What on Earth
are those oafs up to?

1157
01:08:31,486 --> 01:08:33,788
Why don't we go upstairs
and see, yes?

1158
01:08:39,527 --> 01:08:42,131
Do you know
where your mother is?

1159
01:08:42,231 --> 01:08:45,267
No. I think she's in town.

1160
01:08:46,168 --> 01:08:48,904
Has she been spending
much time at home?

1161
01:08:49,704 --> 01:08:51,840
She is quite busy.

1162
01:08:52,341 --> 01:08:53,575
Is she?

1163
01:08:56,045 --> 01:08:58,646
Well, I'm pleased to see
that you're wearing your...

1164
01:08:58,747 --> 01:09:00,149
<i>jugend</i> uniform,

1165
01:09:00,249 --> 01:09:01,951
but...

1166
01:09:02,051 --> 01:09:03,818
where is your knife?

1167
01:09:06,788 --> 01:09:09,291
You must always carry
your DJ knife. Where is it?

1168
01:09:09,392 --> 01:09:13,695
- I left it...
- It's here.

1169
01:09:17,967 --> 01:09:19,969
And who might you be?

1170
01:09:20,069 --> 01:09:23,805
Well, who might you be?
And what are you doing in my house?

1171
01:09:24,572 --> 01:09:26,142
You live here too?

1172
01:09:27,809 --> 01:09:29,311
I'm his sister, Inge.

1173
01:09:31,613 --> 01:09:33,015
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1174
01:09:34,383 --> 01:09:35,418
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1175
01:09:35,518 --> 01:09:36,751
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1176
01:09:36,851 --> 01:09:37,852
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1177
01:09:37,953 --> 01:09:38,853
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1178
01:09:38,954 --> 01:09:39,922
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1179
01:09:40,022 --> 01:09:41,157
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1180
01:09:41,257 --> 01:09:43,758
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1181
01:09:43,858 --> 01:09:46,162
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1182
01:09:46,262 --> 01:09:48,431
I did not know you had a
sister, Johannes.

1183
01:09:48,531 --> 01:09:50,732
Sometimes he'd prefer
if I was dead.

1184
01:09:50,832 --> 01:09:52,902
Isn't that right,
little Frankenstein?

1185
01:09:53,002 --> 01:09:55,337
Now, now.
There is no need to attack

1186
01:09:55,438 --> 01:09:58,074
his hideous
physical deformity.

1187
01:09:58,174 --> 01:10:00,009
That is a war wound.

1188
01:10:00,575 --> 01:10:03,678
But, uh, why do you
have his knife?

1189
01:10:05,247 --> 01:10:08,150
I'm guarding my room because
he refuses to stay out of it.

1190
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:10,219
Well, what do you
have hidden in there?

1191
01:10:10,819 --> 01:10:12,922
Oh, you know, girl stuff.

1192
01:10:14,423 --> 01:10:15,925
May I?

1193
01:10:16,025 --> 01:10:17,059
Naturally.

1194
01:10:23,399 --> 01:10:27,669
You see, we deal with an
inordinate number of reports,

1195
01:10:27,769 --> 01:10:32,108
denunciations
and general investigations.

1196
01:10:32,208 --> 01:10:34,110
And, of course,
we are indeed interested

1197
01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:37,046
in problems of crime
and anti-party sentiment,

1198
01:10:37,146 --> 01:10:40,316
but we still have
one greater concern,

1199
01:10:40,416 --> 01:10:43,519
that of the "Goldilockses."

1200
01:10:44,019 --> 01:10:48,723
Sneaking around,
eating other people's food,

1201
01:10:48,823 --> 01:10:50,725
sleeping in their beds.

1202
01:10:50,825 --> 01:10:52,895
It really is quite rude.

1203
01:10:54,029 --> 01:10:56,265
I don't suppose I could
see your papers, could I?

1204
01:10:57,732 --> 01:11:00,903
Papers, Miss Betzler. Quickly, please.
We don't have all day.

1205
01:11:02,138 --> 01:11:03,671
Yes, of course.

1206
01:11:41,809 --> 01:11:43,678
How old are you in this photo?

1207
01:11:45,881 --> 01:11:47,583
They're three years old.

1208
01:11:47,682 --> 01:11:48,884
I was 14.

1209
01:11:48,984 --> 01:11:50,818
Date of birth?

1210
01:11:53,522 --> 01:11:55,391
First of May.

1211
01:11:55,491 --> 01:11:56,926
1929.

1212
01:12:02,331 --> 01:12:04,266
Correct.
Thank you, Inge.

1213
01:12:04,366 --> 01:12:06,801
Get a new photo. You look
like a ghost in this one.

1214
01:12:06,902 --> 01:12:08,170
Wait.

1215
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:14,310
What is...

1216
01:12:15,611 --> 01:12:16,879
this?

1217
01:12:19,714 --> 01:12:21,250
<i>Yoohoo Jew.</i>

1218
01:12:22,484 --> 01:12:23,851
Tell me, who did this?

1219
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:26,355
I did.

1220
01:12:26,455 --> 01:12:28,157
It's an exposé on Jews.

1221
01:12:28,557 --> 01:12:31,193
How they think, behave, look.

1222
01:12:31,293 --> 01:12:33,028
It'll be a gift to the <i>Führer.</i>

1223
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:37,266
Guys, you have to see this.

1224
01:12:38,601 --> 01:12:40,768
Oh, look at this one.
He has a tail.

1225
01:12:41,136 --> 01:12:44,106
There's one of them hanging
upside down like a bat.

1226
01:12:45,374 --> 01:12:47,977
This one here, it is
a drawing of their heads.

1227
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:51,113
And who is operating
the machinery of their brains?

1228
01:12:51,213 --> 01:12:52,715
The devil.

1229
01:12:52,814 --> 01:12:54,717
Ah, it's funny
'cause it's true.

1230
01:12:54,816 --> 01:12:57,419
Oh, look at
this little, stupid Jew.

1231
01:12:57,519 --> 01:12:59,221
There they are with horns.

1232
01:12:59,321 --> 01:13:00,589
What is this?

1233
01:13:01,023 --> 01:13:03,192
"Die, Nathan, die."

1234
01:13:04,026 --> 01:13:05,827
"Ways of killing Nathan."

1235
01:13:05,928 --> 01:13:07,630
Nathan being tortured
by snakes.

1236
01:13:07,730 --> 01:13:08,796
Poked with sticks.

1237
01:13:08,897 --> 01:13:10,532
Being fired
from a cannon

1238
01:13:10,633 --> 01:13:12,268
and just being called names.

1239
01:13:12,568 --> 01:13:14,970
Yeah. Nathan being
crushed under the wheel

1240
01:13:15,070 --> 01:13:17,273
of an old-time
penny-farthing bicycle.

1241
01:13:17,373 --> 01:13:18,941
Who is Nathan, please?

1242
01:13:20,442 --> 01:13:21,809
Just some boy.

1243
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:24,713
Nathan being
roasted over an open fire.

1244
01:13:24,947 --> 01:13:26,382
Reminds me,
we must get back and...

1245
01:13:26,482 --> 01:13:28,517
- You remember? Cause we left that guy hanging up.
- <i>Ja. Ja.</i>

1246
01:13:28,617 --> 01:13:31,053
Thank you for this.
You have really made my day.

1247
01:13:32,021 --> 01:13:33,622
I do hope
you continue with it.

1248
01:13:33,722 --> 01:13:35,157
And, of course,

1249
01:13:35,257 --> 01:13:38,294
if you see anything suspicious,
give us a ring.

1250
01:13:39,261 --> 01:13:40,362
Good day.

1251
01:13:41,664 --> 01:13:42,631
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1252
01:13:42,731 --> 01:13:44,266
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1253
01:13:52,141 --> 01:13:53,876
Nice to meet you, Inge.

1254
01:13:59,281 --> 01:14:01,050
Stay home, Jojo.

1255
01:14:01,150 --> 01:14:02,551
Look after your family.

1256
01:14:02,651 --> 01:14:04,053
Look after this knife.

1257
01:14:24,807 --> 01:14:26,874
Elsa, you fooled them.

1258
01:14:27,743 --> 01:14:28,977
May seventh.

1259
01:14:30,746 --> 01:14:31,980
What?

1260
01:14:33,549 --> 01:14:37,152
She was born on the seventh,
not the first.

1261
01:14:41,056 --> 01:14:42,391
He was helping us.

1262
01:14:43,659 --> 01:14:45,260
They'll be back.

1263
01:14:45,361 --> 01:14:48,197
They'll figure out she's dead,
then I'll be dead.

1264
01:14:50,632 --> 01:14:53,135
Nobody really knows Inge died.

1265
01:14:55,037 --> 01:14:56,705
You could be her.

1266
01:14:57,473 --> 01:15:00,109
I'll tell Mama everything
when she gets home.

1267
01:15:01,243 --> 01:15:05,047
That I know you
and that we're friends.

1268
01:15:07,182 --> 01:15:09,318
Jew and Nazi are not friends.

1269
01:15:15,290 --> 01:15:17,860
Man, that was a complete bust.

1270
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:19,361
You mind explaining that?

1271
01:15:19,461 --> 01:15:20,629
She's not...

1272
01:15:22,231 --> 01:15:24,400
She doesn't seem
like a bad person.

1273
01:15:28,404 --> 01:15:31,373
I am beginning
to question your loyalty

1274
01:15:31,473 --> 01:15:33,742
to myself and the party.

1275
01:15:33,842 --> 01:15:36,512
You call yourself a patriot?

1276
01:15:36,612 --> 01:15:38,882
Yet, where is the evidence?

1277
01:15:38,981 --> 01:15:42,084
The German soldier
was born out of necessity.

1278
01:15:42,184 --> 01:15:44,553
Germany depends on the passion
of these young men.

1279
01:15:44,653 --> 01:15:47,923
Passion and the readiness
to fall for the Fatherland

1280
01:15:48,023 --> 01:15:52,060
despite the futile efforts
of Allied war profiteers

1281
01:15:52,161 --> 01:15:57,266
who send their ill-prepared armies
clumsily into the lair of the wolf.

1282
01:15:57,366 --> 01:16:01,136
And only zealous men who stand
steadfast in the face of the enemy

1283
01:16:01,236 --> 01:16:04,473
will be etched
in German memory forever.

1284
01:16:04,573 --> 01:16:08,744
And it is up to you to decide
if you want to be remembered,

1285
01:16:08,844 --> 01:16:11,213
or disappear without a trace

1286
01:16:11,313 --> 01:16:15,717
like a pitiful grain of sand
into a desert of insignificance.

1287
01:16:20,924 --> 01:16:22,191
To put it plainly...

1288
01:16:23,425 --> 01:16:26,896
get your shit together
and sort out your priorities.

1289
01:16:26,995 --> 01:16:28,730
You're ten, Jojo.

1290
01:16:28,831 --> 01:16:30,332
Start acting like it.

1291
01:18:13,335 --> 01:18:14,636
No.

1292
01:20:42,919 --> 01:20:43,953
Did you know?

1293
01:20:45,121 --> 01:20:46,655
She didn't tell me much...

1294
01:20:47,456 --> 01:20:49,357
only that she worked
with her friends

1295
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:51,961
and your father was
somehow involved from afar.

1296
01:20:53,361 --> 01:20:55,864
No. He's fighting in the war.

1297
01:20:57,766 --> 01:21:00,602
She said he'll be home
as soon as the war's over.

1298
01:21:01,603 --> 01:21:04,706
She didn't want to tell you
anything for obvious reasons.

1299
01:21:06,109 --> 01:21:07,609
Because she hated me.

1300
01:21:08,410 --> 01:21:09,879
'Cause I'm a Nazi.

1301
01:21:10,947 --> 01:21:12,048
I'm the enemy.

1302
01:21:12,148 --> 01:21:13,348
She didn't want you
to know anything

1303
01:21:13,448 --> 01:21:15,417
that could get you in trouble.

1304
01:21:15,517 --> 01:21:17,285
But now I have nothing.

1305
01:21:19,721 --> 01:21:20,756
No one.

1306
01:21:24,961 --> 01:21:27,829
The last time I saw my parents
was at the station.

1307
01:21:29,564 --> 01:21:31,366
They were put on a train.

1308
01:21:34,137 --> 01:21:35,370
I ran.

1309
01:21:36,205 --> 01:21:38,507
Slowly found my way
back to the city.

1310
01:21:40,109 --> 01:21:41,777
A friend of my father's
hid me.

1311
01:21:41,878 --> 01:21:44,479
Then another friend,
then friends of friends.

1312
01:21:46,748 --> 01:21:48,683
Until your mother took me in.

1313
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,288
And so far, I'm still here.

1314
01:21:56,324 --> 01:21:57,492
But my...

1315
01:21:57,793 --> 01:22:00,963
my parents went to a place
you don't come back from.

1316
01:22:04,967 --> 01:22:07,803
What's the first thing
you'll do when you're free?

1317
01:22:10,273 --> 01:22:11,506
Dance.

1318
01:24:03,185 --> 01:24:05,087
That's it. That's it. Hurry.

1319
01:24:24,907 --> 01:24:26,042
Yorki?

1320
01:24:26,409 --> 01:24:28,110
Jojo!

1321
01:24:31,981 --> 01:24:33,082
Oh, God.

1322
01:24:33,448 --> 01:24:34,616
Jojo.

1323
01:24:34,984 --> 01:24:36,651
How I've missed you.

1324
01:24:37,652 --> 01:24:39,688
Sorry about your mama.

1325
01:24:39,788 --> 01:24:42,757
I cried for ages
when I heard what happened.

1326
01:24:44,393 --> 01:24:45,593
What's going on out here?

1327
01:24:45,694 --> 01:24:47,897
The Russians, Jojo.
They're coming.

1328
01:24:47,997 --> 01:24:49,899
And the Americans
from the other way.

1329
01:24:49,999 --> 01:24:53,402
And England and China
and Africa and India.

1330
01:24:53,501 --> 01:24:55,503
The whole world is coming.

1331
01:24:55,603 --> 01:24:57,173
Help me with this ammo.

1332
01:24:59,275 --> 01:25:00,977
- And how are we doing?
- Terribly.

1333
01:25:01,077 --> 01:25:03,012
Our only friends
are the Japanese.

1334
01:25:03,112 --> 01:25:06,715
And just between you and me,
they don't look very Aryan.

1335
01:25:07,083 --> 01:25:09,385
- Remember that Jew I told you about?
- Oh, yeah.

1336
01:25:09,484 --> 01:25:10,552
I still have her.

1337
01:25:10,652 --> 01:25:12,288
She's basically
my girlfriend now.

1338
01:25:12,388 --> 01:25:15,091
Oh, good for you, Jojo.
A girlfriend.

1339
01:25:15,191 --> 01:25:18,693
But, you know, she's Jewish.

1340
01:25:18,793 --> 01:25:21,830
There are bigger things to
worry about than Jews, Jojo.

1341
01:25:21,931 --> 01:25:24,266
There's Russians
somewhere out there.

1342
01:25:24,367 --> 01:25:26,002
They're worse than anyone.

1343
01:25:26,102 --> 01:25:29,472
I heard they eat babies
and have sex with dogs.

1344
01:25:29,571 --> 01:25:31,539
I mean, like,
that's bad, right?

1345
01:25:31,639 --> 01:25:32,707
Sex with dogs?

1346
01:25:32,807 --> 01:25:35,011
Yeah.
The Englishmen do it, too.

1347
01:25:35,111 --> 01:25:38,546
We have to stop them before they
eat us and screw all our dogs.

1348
01:25:38,646 --> 01:25:39,848
It's crazy.

1349
01:25:39,949 --> 01:25:42,751
And now Hitler's gone,
we're really on our own.

1350
01:25:44,853 --> 01:25:47,957
- What?
- You didn't hear?

1351
01:25:48,057 --> 01:25:49,557
He's dead.

1352
01:25:49,657 --> 01:25:51,726
He gave up
and blew his brains out.

1353
01:25:51,826 --> 01:25:53,229
No.

1354
01:25:53,329 --> 01:25:54,430
That's impossible.

1355
01:25:54,529 --> 01:25:55,864
Blew them out.

1356
01:25:55,965 --> 01:25:57,033
His brains.

1357
01:25:57,133 --> 01:25:59,801
Turns out he was hiding
a lot of stuff from us.

1358
01:25:59,902 --> 01:26:02,670
Doing some really bad things
behind everyone's backs.

1359
01:26:02,771 --> 01:26:04,839
I'm not sure
we chose the right side.

1360
01:26:20,122 --> 01:26:22,992
Okay. Come here. Okay.
See that American there?

1361
01:26:23,092 --> 01:26:26,395
Just go give him a hug.
Go! Run! Let's go!

1362
01:26:26,495 --> 01:26:28,264
Oh, Yorki. Yorki, great news.

1363
01:26:28,364 --> 01:26:30,799
You've just been promoted,
and you get your own pistol.

1364
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:33,402
Just go and shoot anybody
who looks different to us.

1365
01:26:33,502 --> 01:26:35,837
- Okay.
- Okay.

1366
01:26:35,938 --> 01:26:37,839
Jojo, where's your uniform?

1367
01:26:38,706 --> 01:26:40,943
Here. Here,
put the jacket on

1368
01:26:41,043 --> 01:26:42,744
so they know not to shoot you.

1369
01:26:43,913 --> 01:26:46,614
We must kill everything
that we see.

1370
01:26:46,714 --> 01:26:47,950
For Hitler.

1371
01:26:49,185 --> 01:26:51,220
Die, devil scum!

1372
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:52,787
Die!

1373
01:27:06,235 --> 01:27:07,269
Fall out!

1374
01:28:26,081 --> 01:28:30,386
Whoo! Ha!

1375
01:28:30,486 --> 01:28:32,888
<i>Ja.</i>

1376
01:28:55,710 --> 01:28:57,012
Come. This way.

1377
01:29:06,721 --> 01:29:07,957
They are here!

1378
01:29:09,658 --> 01:29:11,227
The Americans!

1379
01:29:15,863 --> 01:29:17,299
Come on.

1380
01:29:17,399 --> 01:29:19,834
- Stay on him.
- Behind you, Cap.

1381
01:29:20,768 --> 01:29:23,305
Over here. Come on, go!

1382
01:29:54,470 --> 01:29:56,038
I'll check him.

1383
01:30:07,016 --> 01:30:10,052
Hey, boys! Whoo-hoo!

1384
01:30:16,992 --> 01:30:18,761
Move the prisoners.

1385
01:30:18,860 --> 01:30:21,330
Keep the prisoners
all in line.

1386
01:30:30,872 --> 01:30:32,341
Quickly. Quickly!

1387
01:30:34,243 --> 01:30:36,278
Hey! Hey!

1388
01:30:38,314 --> 01:30:39,982
What?

1389
01:30:40,949 --> 01:30:43,652
I-I don't understand.

1390
01:30:43,752 --> 01:30:46,422
Move! Move!

1391
01:30:47,990 --> 01:30:49,391
Get up, wretched dog.

1392
01:30:54,730 --> 01:30:56,231
Captain K.

1393
01:30:56,332 --> 01:30:58,000
Heya, kid.

1394
01:30:58,100 --> 01:30:59,668
Look at
all this commotion, huh?

1395
01:30:59,768 --> 01:31:01,937
- What's happening?
- Hysteria, my friend.

1396
01:31:02,037 --> 01:31:03,739
We've come...
We've come to the end.

1397
01:31:04,006 --> 01:31:05,908
- Party's over.
- No, I'm not like them.

1398
01:31:06,008 --> 01:31:08,744
- Are you scared? Don't be scared.
- No. Please.

1399
01:31:08,843 --> 01:31:11,380
- Look at me.
- No. No.

1400
01:31:13,415 --> 01:31:16,218
I'm sorry about Rosie.
She was a good person.

1401
01:31:20,723 --> 01:31:22,191
An actual good person.

1402
01:31:24,226 --> 01:31:25,461
Okay?

1403
01:31:26,428 --> 01:31:28,797
Hey. It's okay, kid.

1404
01:31:28,897 --> 01:31:31,400
Shh, shh, shh.

1405
01:31:32,867 --> 01:31:36,772
I've been meaning to tell you.
I think your book is really great.

1406
01:31:36,871 --> 01:31:38,807
<i>Ja,</i> I'm sorry
for laughing at it.

1407
01:31:38,907 --> 01:31:40,008
Very creative.

1408
01:31:40,509 --> 01:31:42,277
Come here,
let's take a look at you.

1409
01:31:43,379 --> 01:31:44,480
You look good.

1410
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:45,647
You're okay, kid.

1411
01:31:47,249 --> 01:31:49,651
Now, go home. Look after
that sister of yours.

1412
01:31:49,752 --> 01:31:51,286
Okay?

1413
01:31:52,488 --> 01:31:54,757
Get away. Get away, Jew.

1414
01:31:55,324 --> 01:31:57,459
- Hey! What's going on?
- Get away!

1415
01:31:57,559 --> 01:32:00,095
- He's a Jew.
- Shut up. You know this Nazi?

1416
01:32:00,195 --> 01:32:02,030
- He helped us.
- No, I don't know this dirty Jew.

1417
01:32:02,131 --> 01:32:03,232
No, no...

1418
01:32:03,332 --> 01:32:04,700
- Get away, Jew.
- Hey. Hey!

1419
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:07,169
Shut your mouth, Nazi.

1420
01:32:07,269 --> 01:32:09,571
- No! No! No!
- Get out of here. Go home.

1421
01:32:10,339 --> 01:32:13,108
- No! Leave him alone!
- Go home!

1422
01:32:13,208 --> 01:32:14,543
No!

1423
01:32:15,411 --> 01:32:17,579
- Get off!
- Get out of here.

1424
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:18,914
Go home!

1425
01:32:33,328 --> 01:32:34,363
Jojo?

1426
01:32:37,599 --> 01:32:38,700
Yorki!

1427
01:32:40,068 --> 01:32:42,404
Thank God.
I thought you were dead.

1428
01:32:42,504 --> 01:32:45,007
No. It seems like
I can never die.

1429
01:32:45,441 --> 01:32:47,709
I'm gonna go home
and see my mother.

1430
01:32:48,110 --> 01:32:49,578
I need a cuddle.

1431
01:32:49,678 --> 01:32:52,047
- Nothing makes sense anymore.
<i>Ja,</i> I know.

1432
01:32:52,147 --> 01:32:54,616
It's definitely not
a good time to be a Nazi.

1433
01:32:55,317 --> 01:32:57,453
Hey. So now the war's over,

1434
01:32:57,553 --> 01:32:59,621
at least your girlfriend
will be free.

1435
01:33:00,189 --> 01:33:01,557
She can leave now.

1436
01:33:03,392 --> 01:33:04,426
Something wrong?

1437
01:33:05,694 --> 01:33:07,029
I've got to go.

1438
01:33:07,129 --> 01:33:08,497
- Okay.
- Sorry.

1439
01:33:08,597 --> 01:33:10,466
Later!

1440
01:34:01,617 --> 01:34:03,118
Hi. I'm home.

1441
01:34:03,218 --> 01:34:05,254
What's going on out there?

1442
01:34:07,991 --> 01:34:11,493
- Out where?
- Outside, dummy.

1443
01:34:12,929 --> 01:34:14,396
Jojo, what's going on?

1444
01:34:16,598 --> 01:34:18,233
Is it safe to come out?

1445
01:34:21,236 --> 01:34:22,704
Jojo, is it safe?

1446
01:34:24,606 --> 01:34:25,641
Can I leave?

1447
01:34:27,944 --> 01:34:29,177
No.

1448
01:34:33,482 --> 01:34:35,717
You can't leave.

1449
01:34:35,817 --> 01:34:37,085
Why?

1450
01:34:37,185 --> 01:34:39,421
You have to stay here...

1451
01:34:39,521 --> 01:34:40,289
Who won?

1452
01:34:40,389 --> 01:34:42,424
...with me.

1453
01:34:42,524 --> 01:34:44,693
Jojo, who won...
who won the war?

1454
01:34:48,965 --> 01:34:50,198
We did.

1455
01:34:54,102 --> 01:34:55,470
Germany won the war.

1456
01:35:09,052 --> 01:35:11,186
I-I'm sorry.

1457
01:36:30,699 --> 01:36:31,733
"Dear Elsa.

1458
01:36:33,301 --> 01:36:35,604
"I know it's hard for you
at the moment...

1459
01:36:36,438 --> 01:36:38,473
"and I know
you feel like giving up.

1460
01:36:39,876 --> 01:36:41,343
"But you have to carry on.

1461
01:36:42,177 --> 01:36:43,645
"Me and your good friend, Jojo,

1462
01:36:43,745 --> 01:36:46,281
"have devised a plan
for you to escape.

1463
01:36:47,516 --> 01:36:49,251
"So, please listen to him.

1464
01:36:50,285 --> 01:36:52,354
"He's gonna help you
get out of there.

1465
01:36:52,454 --> 01:36:54,856
"And then you can
come live with me in Paris.

1466
01:36:56,858 --> 01:36:58,794
"And don't worry about Jojo.

1467
01:37:02,798 --> 01:37:03,832
"He'll be okay.

1468
01:37:06,702 --> 01:37:08,603
"See you in Paris.

1469
01:37:08,704 --> 01:37:09,738
Nathan."

1470
01:37:18,948 --> 01:37:20,917
- He's dead.
- Pardon?

1471
01:37:21,650 --> 01:37:23,052
Nathan.

1472
01:37:23,152 --> 01:37:24,720
He died last year.

1473
01:37:25,787 --> 01:37:27,322
Tuberculosis.

1474
01:37:30,093 --> 01:37:33,295
Well... that's weird.

1475
01:37:33,395 --> 01:37:34,696
Who wrote these?

1476
01:37:37,365 --> 01:37:38,867
Thank you, Jojo.

1477
01:37:42,504 --> 01:37:44,406
You have been so good to me.

1478
01:37:46,475 --> 01:37:51,013
Well, the thing is,
I love you.

1479
01:37:52,081 --> 01:37:55,584
I know you think of me as a
younger brother, which is fine,

1480
01:37:55,684 --> 01:37:59,088
and, um,
you're too old anyway.

1481
01:37:59,188 --> 01:38:00,522
But...

1482
01:38:01,323 --> 01:38:03,625
Man, it's quite hot in here.

1483
01:38:05,727 --> 01:38:07,163
I love you, too.

1484
01:38:07,262 --> 01:38:09,765
- As a younger brother.
- As a younger brother.

1485
01:38:09,865 --> 01:38:14,036
Look, me and fake Nathan have
found a way for you to escape.

1486
01:38:16,772 --> 01:38:18,975
Maybe you can trust
a younger brother?

1487
01:38:20,675 --> 01:38:21,710
Maybe.

1488
01:38:23,712 --> 01:38:25,114
Okay, then.

1489
01:38:25,214 --> 01:38:27,116
Get your things together.

1490
01:38:27,216 --> 01:38:28,450
We're leaving.

1491
01:38:35,290 --> 01:38:36,591
Jojo Betzler.

1492
01:38:37,626 --> 01:38:39,494
Ten and a half years old.

1493
01:38:40,796 --> 01:38:41,830
Today,

1494
01:38:43,199 --> 01:38:44,566
just do what you can.

1495
01:38:46,601 --> 01:38:49,638
Where in the shit do you
think you're going, hmm?

1496
01:38:49,738 --> 01:38:52,340
- Out.
- Out? Oh, no, you don't.

1497
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:54,243
No, we're gonna stay in here

1498
01:38:54,342 --> 01:38:56,478
and you're gonna tell me
exactly what's going on

1499
01:38:56,578 --> 01:38:58,214
with you and that thing
in the attic.

1500
01:38:58,313 --> 01:38:59,815
That "thing" is a girl.

1501
01:38:59,916 --> 01:39:02,084
- You're in love with her, aren't you?
- Yes.

1502
01:39:02,185 --> 01:39:04,086
- Admit it.
- I just said yes.

1503
01:39:04,187 --> 01:39:05,420
I knew it!

1504
01:39:06,621 --> 01:39:08,323
Well, it's never gonna work out.

1505
01:39:09,357 --> 01:39:11,894
No. No, she's too old for you.
And you're ugly.

1506
01:39:12,327 --> 01:39:14,863
You know she's gonna leave you.
You know that, don't you?

1507
01:39:14,964 --> 01:39:18,267
So, here's what's
gonna happen, you little shit.

1508
01:39:18,366 --> 01:39:20,136
You're gonna
put this on, okay?

1509
01:39:20,236 --> 01:39:23,705
You're gonna forget about that
disgusting Jewy cow up there.

1510
01:39:23,805 --> 01:39:27,109
And you're gonna come
back to me, where you belong.

1511
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:28,244
Right?

1512
01:39:28,343 --> 01:39:29,979
Put it on.

1513
01:39:30,079 --> 01:39:32,982
And then, we're gonna pretend
none of this ever happened.

1514
01:39:33,082 --> 01:39:34,116
You got it?

1515
01:39:40,522 --> 01:39:42,691
You're not gonna <i>heil</i> me?

1516
01:39:42,791 --> 01:39:44,526
Come on? For old time's sake?

1517
01:39:44,626 --> 01:39:46,896
<i>Heil</i> me, little man.
- No.

1518
01:39:46,996 --> 01:39:48,164
<i>Heil</i> me.
- No.

1519
01:39:48,264 --> 01:39:50,333
Give me a little <i>heil.</i>
Just a little <i>heil.</i> Please?

1520
01:39:50,432 --> 01:39:51,700
Fuck off, Hitler.

1521
01:40:01,443 --> 01:40:02,677
Come on.

1522
01:40:05,780 --> 01:40:06,815
Oh. Wait.

1523
01:40:22,098 --> 01:40:23,732
Ready?

1524
01:40:23,832 --> 01:40:24,866
Yeah.

1525
01:40:29,571 --> 01:40:31,073
Is it dangerous out there?

1526
01:40:34,911 --> 01:40:35,945
Extremely.

1527
01:41:04,173 --> 01:41:05,207
Yeah!

1528
01:41:08,277 --> 01:41:09,245
Whoo!

1529
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:37,772
We made it.

1530
01:41:43,045 --> 01:41:44,612
Probably deserved that.

1531
01:41:57,625 --> 01:41:59,095
What do we do now?

1532
01:43:21,043 --> 01:43:22,510
